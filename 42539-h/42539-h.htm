Wine&mdash;View from the Citadel-hill&mdash;A Change of Bedrooms&mdash;Coming

<p class="p2">"How happens it," I said to a bookseller in the <i>Zeil</i>,
"that a map of Bohemia is not to be had in all Frankfort?"</p>

<p>"How it happens?" he answered, with a knowing
smile: "because no one ever goes to Bohemia."</p>

<p>He searched and searched, as did a dozen of his fraternity
whom I had previously visited, and found maps
in number of Switzerland, Tyrol, Thuringia, Franconia,
Turkey even, and Montenegro; but not the one
I wanted.</p>

<p>"Such a thing is never asked for," he said, deprecatingly.
"Suppose you go to Franconia instead."</p>

<p>All at once he bethought himself of an inner closet,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">2</a></span>
and there he discovered a map of Bohemia; but not a
travelling map: an overcrowded sheet that confused the
eye, and promised but little assistance for the byeways.
However, under the circumstances, I took it as better
than none.</p>

<p>"You will not get the map you want till you arrive
at Prague," was the sort of encouragement I got some
twenty-four hours afterwards from a Bohemian Professor
in the Medical School at Würzburg.</p>

<p>I saw Frankfort under all the charm of a first visit.
I perambulated the narrow streets, and the <i>Judengasse</i>,
where dwell not a few of the nine thousand Jewish
residents; and stood long enough on the bridge that
bestrides the muddy Main to note the ancient towers,
and the bits of antiquity peeping up here and there in
the city and the Sachsenshausen suburb&mdash;contrasted by
the modern look of the spacious quays. And of course
I saw the house in which Goethe was born, and Dannecker's
Ariadne, and the Römer, that relic of the
olden time, crowded with reminiscences of the Empire.
You may see the whole line of Emperors in panels
round the wainscot of the stately hall on the first
floor; some grim warriors in plate and mail; some in
scholar's gown; some in slashed sleeves and tight hosen,
and some in velvet robes. Here, after the crown had
been placed on their heads in the adjacent cathedral,
they went through certain formal ceremonies with cumbrous
pomp and held their festival, as may be read in
the vivid descriptions of Goethe's <i>Autobiography</i>.</p>

<p>Having glanced at the imperial effigies from Conrad
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">3</a></span>
down to Francis, and at the scene from the balcony
outside, I dropped half a franc into the hand of the
lady portress, and had crossed the landing, when she
came tripping after me, and, with an air of lofty pity,
returned the coin, requesting me to "give it to a
beggar."</p>

<p>The gentleman in charge of the Ariadne had made
me a polite bow for a similar fee; so I complied with
the lady's request, and gave the piece of silver among
five beggars, each of whom favoured me with a blessing
in return.</p>

<p>At noon, on the 3rd of July, I left Frankfort for
Würzburg. The landscape at first is tame, and you
will have to watch closely, in more senses than one, as
the train speeds across, for the scenes and objects that
relieve it. There are glimpses of the Taunus mountains;
of Wilhelmsbad, embowered in a pleasant wood;
of Hanau, a dark-red town, where the dark-red sandstone
station is enlivened by Virginian creeper running
gracefully up the columns; and of memorable battlefields.
And of a dark-red mill, in a green grassy hollow,
with its dripping wheel; and in the middle of the
garden a globe of fire that dazzles your eye, and is
nothing other than a carboy inverted on a stake, after
the Dutch manner, to serve as a mirror, in which may
be seen a panorama of the neighbourhood. And everywhere
women cutting down the rye, wearing bright
red kerchiefs on their heads that rival the poppies in
splendour.</p>

<p>Beyond Aschaffenburg the country improves. Wooded
hills alternate with lengthy slopes of vines, deep shady
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
coombs, and leafy valleys, where brooks frolic along in
frequent windings, and villages nestle, and gray church
spires shoot above the tree-tops. Then parties of woodcutters,
well armed with axes and wedges, enter the
train, and each man lights his pipe, and they talk of
their craft among themselves in a rustic dialect. And
the train dashes into the forest of Spessart, and under
the hills, winding hither and thither between miles of
trees, the remains, as is said, of that great Hercynian
forest which schoolboys read about in their Latin
studies. The nursery of them that overthrew Rome;
and one of the haunts of Freedom before she took refuge
in the mountains, and in a certain island of the
sea.</p>

<p>At Lohr, a town prettily situate on the Main, the
railway road and river come near together, and the frequent
windings of the stream brighten the landscape.
We saw the steamer labouring upwards on her two
days' trip from Frankfort to Würzburg. Then a village
where the Saal falls in, and more and more vines,
and old walls gay with yellow stonecrop, and on the
right the ruin of Karlstadt, and by-and-by Würzburg
comes in sight, and our five hours' journey is over.</p>

<p>Bavarian art attracts and gratifies your eye as you
alight. The station is an elegant structure in the Pompeiian
style, ingeniously contrived for the purposes of
the railway and post-office, and yet to preserve the
architectural character. An impatient traveller might
well beguile the time by admiring the proportions, the
colouring, and the tasteful decorations along the colonnades.
The building forms one side of a square in the
newest quarter of the town.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span></p>

<p>A curious sign, the <i>Kleebaum</i>, caught my eye in
the first street, and I trusted myself beneath it. The
<i>Kellner</i> took my knapsack; asked if "that was all,"
and led me high up to a small homely-furnished room
on the third floor, in which, however, the quality of
cleanliness was not wanting, and that is what an Englishman
cares most about. At dinner I treated myself
to a pint of the Stein wine, for which the neighbourhood
is famous, and am prepared to add my testimony
as to its merits. The bottles have a jolly bacchanalian
look about them, being globes somewhat flattened at
the sides, and contain, when honest, a quart. The cost
is from two to three florins a bottle; but a temperate
guest is allowed to drink and pay for the half
only, at his pleasure. With vineyards producing such
wine around them, it is little wonder that the Prince-Bishops
were always ready to fight for their good city
of Würzburg. The <i>Strangers' Book</i> followed the dinner
as a matter of course, and when the landlord saw that
I signed my name as "from London," and heard me
inquire for the residence of one of the Professors, he
put off his natural manner and became obsequious: a
change that gave me no pleasure.</p>

<p>There is more of life, more to interest the attention in
Würzburg, than in some places which are much more
frequented and talked of. The streets generally are
narrow, and built in picturesque disregard of straight
lines; now widening suddenly for a brief space, now
diminishing and bending away in a new direction. And
you saunter onwards, wondering at the panelled house-fronts
with their profuse ornament: grotesque carvings
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
of animals' heads, of clustering fruits in bold relief at
the intersections; windows with quaint canopies and
curiously-wrought gratings; fanciful door-heads and
gables; in short, a variety of architectural conceits on
which your eye will fondly linger. Now, at a corner,
you come upon an ancient turret with conical roof, now
a sculptured fountain, now images of the Virgin or
some of the saints over the doors; and anon huge
statues of the Bishops remind you of the men who
built and prayed for Würzburg. So numerous are the
churches erected to perpetuate their memory or adorn
their inheritance, that you need not go many yards
whenever you feel inclined to meditate in a "dim religious
light."</p>

<p>You meet numbers of soldiers, for there is a citadel
beyond the river, and water-bearers with their tall tubs
slung on their backs going to or from the fountains,
and now and then a peasant woman with conical hat
and skirts the very opposite of the fashion; and except
that nearly all the women you see are bareheaded, there
is nothing else remarkable in costume.</p>

<p>Stroll to the river-side; what prodigious piles of firewood
at one side of the quay, and what a busy fleet of
barges moored on the other. The Main here is about as
wide as the Thames at Richmond, and is spanned by a
bridge quite in keeping with the city. At either end
stands an arched gateway, with statues niched in the
massive masonry, and saints above the rounded piers.</p>

<p>Cross the bridge, and mount the citadel-hill on the
left bank, and you will have a surprise. The hill terminates
in a craggy precipice, crowned by the stronghold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
and its defences, and you look down on shelfy gardens
planted here and there among the rocks; and over the
whole city. The river flows by in a bold curve, cutting
off a small suburb from the main portion of the city,
which spreads, crescent-formed, on the opposite shore.
An imposing scene. Thirty-one towers, spires, domes,
and steeples spring from the great masses and ridges of
dark-red lofty roofs, and these are everywhere dotted
with rows of little windows which resemble a half-opened
eye. Indeed, the curved line of the tiles makes
the resemblance so complete, that you can easily fancy
the eyes are taking a sly peep at what is going on
below, or winking at the sunbeams, as a prelude to
falling asleep for the night.</p>

<p>The sun was dropping behind me in the west, and
before me lay the city, looking glorious in the golden
light. Row after row of the sleepy eyes caught the ray
with a momentary twinkle; the gilded weathercocks
flashed and glistened, and the reflection falling on the
river made pathways of quivering light across the
ripples.</p>

<p>Presently eight struck from the cathedral, and the
clocks of all the churches followed, each with its own
peculiar note. One or two solemn and sonorous, in
imitation of the big bell; others shrill and saucy, as if
they alone had the right to record the march of the
silent footsteps; a few sedate, and one irresolute. Now
here, now there, now yonder, as if the striking never
would cease, and suggesting strange analogies between
clocks and the race who wind them up.</p>

<p>Trees rise here and there among the houses, and form
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
a green belt round the city, thickest in the gardens of
the royal palace, a stately edifice comprising among its
two hundred and eighty-four rooms the suite in which
the Emperors used to lodge when on their way to be
crowned at Frankfort. And beyond the trees begin the
vines, acre after acre to the tops of the whole encircling
rim of hills. Broad slopes teeming with wine and
gladness of heart, but looking bald in the distance from
want of trees. One of these hills&mdash;the <i>Köppele</i>, so
named from a chapel on the summit&mdash;is a favourite
resort of the inhabitants, who perhaps find in the view
therefrom a sufficient reward for a long ascent, unrefreshed
by shade or rustling leaves.</p>

<p>Seen from the hill, Würzburg is said to resemble
Prague; not without reason, as I afterwards found. It
would be, in my opinion, the more pleasing picture of
the two, were its frame set off and beautified by patches
of forest.</p>

<p>I kept my seat on the outward angle of a thick wall
till the golden light, sliding slowly up the hills, at last
vanished from their brow, and left the whole valley in
shadow. Then I went down and sauntered about the
streets, while the gloom within the porticos and gateways,
behind buttresses and up the narrow alleys,
deepened and deepened; and ended by discovering a
stranger willing to talk in a well-lighted coffee-house.</p>

<p>On my return to the <i>Kleebaum</i> the <i>Kellner</i> lit two
candles, and conducted me, not to the little room "up
three pair," but to the best bedroom on the first floor.</p>

<p>What magic in that little item&mdash;"from London!"</p>

<p>Now, gracious reader, suppose we come to an understanding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
before I get into bed. You are already aware
that I am going to Bohemia, not to scale snow-crowned
mountains, or plunge into awful gorges, for there are
none. The highest summit we shall have to climb
together is under five thousand feet; and there is none
of that tremendous and magnificent scenery which is to
be seen in Switzerland and Tyrol. If, however, you are
willing to accompany me to a peculiar country&mdash;one
which, like Ireland, is most picturesque around its borders&mdash;rich
in memorials of the past and in historical
associations, fertile and industrious, we will journey
lovingly together. Now on foot, though perhaps not so
much as usual; now a flight by rail, or a steam-boat
trip, or by diligence or wagon, according as the circumstances
befall. We shall find on the way occasion
for discourse, somewhat to observe, for the people are
remarkable, and subjects to read about; improving the
hours as best we may.</p>

<p>Our next halt shall be at the old Saxon town of
Altenburg, where there is something to be seen and
heard of worth remembering; then over the <i>Erzgebirge</i>
to Carlsbad, the bathing-place of kings, and through
the rustic villages to Prague. Then to the <i>Mittelgebirge</i>;
down the Elbe, to a scene of rural life and industry;
away to the <i>Riesengebirge</i>&mdash;the mountains haunted by
Rübezahl&mdash;and the wonderful rocks of Adersbach.
Then over the frontier into Silesia, to Herrnhut, the
head-quarters of the Moravians, to Dresden and the
Saxon Switzerland, Berlin, Magdeburg, and Hamburg,
from whence a voyage across the North Sea will bring
us home again.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span></p>

<p>It may be that this scheme is not to your liking. If
so, we can part company here, and you will perhaps
never read the completion of that "Story of the King
of Bohemia and his Seven Castles," which Corporal
Trim began for Uncle Toby and never finished.</p>

<p>And so, good night!

</p>

<p class="p2">Würzburg is now the chief town of the Circle of the
Lower Main; it was once the capital of a principality
governed by a line of eighty bishops, and figures prominently
in German history. The University, founded
in 1403, is deservedly famous, having numbered among
its professors many of first-rate abilities: a distinction it
still retains. What with schools, with resources in art and
science, cultivated society, and ample means of recreation,
the old city is an agreeable residence.</p>

<p>Under the guidance of Professor Kölliker, I visited
the botanic garden, the anatomical museum, and the
medical school, which is one of the best in Europe. The
Julius Hospital, a noble institution, founded by one of
the Prince-Bishops, whose statue is erected not far from
the building, affords opportunities for study seldom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
found in provincial towns. The students, after the
manner of their kind, form themselves into societies distinguished
by the colour of their caps, as you will soon
discover by meeting continually in the streets little
groups of red, green, or orange caps, marking the three
divisions.</p>

<p>Then, while the Professor lectured to his class, I
strolled away to the market-place, and saw how the
women, leaving their shoulder-baskets at the door of the
<i>Marienkapelle</i>&mdash;Mary Chapel&mdash;went in and recited a
few prayers, kneeling on the floor. A commendable
preparation, I thought, for the work of buying and
selling. The mounds of vegetables in frequent rows, and
numerous baskets of cherries and strawberries, with
heaps of fresh dewy flowers between, the many red kerchiefs
and moving throng, and the wares displayed at
the wooden booths, made up an animated spectacle.
Live geese roosting contentedly in shallow baskets awaiting
their sale without an effort to escape, were remarkable
among the enticements of the poultry-market. A
few yards farther were little stalls with rolls of butter,
resembling in shape a ship's topsail-yard, alternating
with piles of lumps or rather dabs of butter, each wrapped
in a piece of old newspaper. These were bought
by poor folk.</p>

<p>The <i>Marienkapelle</i> is a fine specimen of pointed
Gothic, with a graceful spire, which having become dilapidated
and unsafe, was undergoing repair at the time
of my visit. The inside is spoiled by overmuch whitewash,
and the outside by an irregular row of petty shops&mdash;an
uncouth plinthe&mdash;around the base; and this is not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
the only church in the city which has its character and
fair proportions marred by such clustering barnacles.</p>

<p>On the spot where the cathedral now stands rearing
its four towers aloft, St. Killian, an Irish missionary,
was martyred more than a thousand years ago. The
lofty arched nave is supported by square columns, of
which the lower portions are hidden by pictures.
Marble statues of the Bishops, with sword and crosier in
hand, betokening their twofold character of priest and
warrior, are ranged along the walls; and the whole interior
has a bright and cheerful aspect.</p>

<p>Of the other churches, I need not say more than that
the New Minster enjoys the honour of possessing St.
Killian's bones; that St. Peter's at Rome is reproduced
in the church of St. John; and that St. Burkhardt's, at
the foot of the citadel-hill, is built in the round style.</p>

<p>The spacious grounds and gardens of the palace are
well laid out. There are umbrageous avenues, terraces,
fountains, paths winding among flower-beds and away
under the trees and through the shrubberies to nooks of
complete solitude. In some parts the plantations are
left untrimmed, and give an air of wildness to the scene.
In the rear, steps lead to the top of the wall, from
whence you may look over greater part of the grounds,
and fancy yourself in a region of forest. The townsfolk
have free access; and you meet now and then a solitary
student poring over his book, or groups of strollers, or
nursemaids with troops of children. The palace, which
dates from the year 1720, shows the consequences of
neglect. Hohenschwangau has greater attractions for
the royal family than Würzburg; and now, after a view
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
of the staircase and chapel, there is nothing in the rusty
and faded apartments that once exhibited the magnificence
of the Bishops to detain you. The cellars are
large enough to contain 2200 tuns of wine. What
rollicking nights the retainers must have had!</p>

<p>The Professor proved himself not less hospitable than
learned. We dined together, and he introduced me to
one of his colleagues, the Bohemian mentioned in the
second page, who gave me a letter to his father at Prague.
And then, after a sojourn of twenty-four hours, I departed.</p>

<p>To see Nuremberg, and journey from thence into
Bohemia, across the <i>Böhmerwaldgebirge</i>, had been in
my thoughts; but finding on inquiry that more time
would be required for that route than I could spare, I
decided for Saxony. So, away to Bamberg, sixty miles
distant, the starting-place of the Leipzig and Nuremberg
trains. There was an hour to wait, and then in
deep twilight on we went for Altenburg.</p>

<p>Although the night was in July, I shivered with cold.
The temperature, indeed, was remarkable. Three days
previously I had seen white frost between Aix-la-Chapelle
and Cologne, and for the first ten nights of the
month frosts occurred all over Germany. At two
o'clock we came to Hof, where there was a change of
train, and time to drink a cup of coffee, doubly acceptable
under the circumstances. The country around is
bleak, a region of bare low hills, of unfavourable repute
owing to its cold. A farmer who came into the train
told us there was thin ice on the ponds. Here and
there the hollows were filled with a dense mist, and resembled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">15</a></span>
vast lakes, and the outlook was so cheerless
that I was glad to sleep, till sunrise, with its splendours,
woke up our drowsy party to welcome light and
warmth.</p>

<p>What a change since the former year! Then the war
was all the topic among those who were thrown together
while travelling. Now, Sebastopol and the
Crimea seemed clean forgotten, and no one had a word
to say even about the Sick Man at Constantinople. No,
all was changed, and talkers busied their tongues concerning
the "shabby peace," as they called it, the dearness
of food, and&mdash;William Palmer. The simple-minded
Bavarians could not understand why England should
have been so magnanimous towards her Muscovitish
antagonist, until it was suggested to them that France,
having come to the bottom of her purse notwithstanding
all the flourishes to the contrary, the war had to be
ended.</p>

<p>"And could England have kept on?"</p>

<p>"Yes, for forty years, if necessary."</p>

<p>"What a country!" they exclaimed&mdash;"what gigantic
wealth!" And then they wondered that peace had
not brought lower prices, and talked with grave faces
and timorous forebodings about the dearness of bread.
Scarcely a place did I visit where bread was not dearer
than in London.</p>

<p>But the arch-poisoner was the prevailing theme; and
eager discussions on the incidents of his trial and execution
showed how widespread was the excitement he had
occasioned. Even in little towns I saw <i>Prozess gegen
William Palmer</i> for sale in the booksellers' windows.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
The Germans, however, thought theirs the best law, as
it inflicts perpetual imprisonment only, and not death,
in cases where the poison is not discovered in the body
of the victim; and they would by no means agree that
to hang a villain out of the way whether or no, was the
preferable alternative. While the talk was going on,
some one was sure to tell of what took place when
the news of the execution was flashed from England.
<i>Palmer is hanged</i>, was the brief yet fearful despatch.
The clerk who received it, by some strange fatality, read
<i>Palmer</i> as an abbreviation of <i>Palmerston</i>; and within
an hour all Germany was startled by the news, and bewildered
with speculations as to the causes which had
induced the exemplary English nation to get rid of their
Prime Minister by so summary a process. "<i>Palmerston
gehänget!</i>" ejaculated one after another, with a chuckle.</p>

<p>At seven o'clock we arrived at Altenburg. A night
in a railway train is not the best preparation for a day
of sight-seeing. However, after the restorative of a
wash and breakfast at the <i>Bayerische Hof</i>, the first hotel
that presented itself, I crossed the road to the grounds
belonging to the castle. By a bold undulating slope,
laid out as an English park, you mount to a plateau,
where a well-kept garden contrasts agreeably with the
tall avenues and grouped masses of foliage. Small
pleasure-houses stand here and there among the trees,
and you see a pavilion built in the style of a Greek
temple. A little farther, and there are the ducal opera-house,
the orangery, and the stables&mdash;a handsome range
of buildings. And beyond is the Little Forest&mdash;<i>Wäldchen</i>&mdash;enclosed
by a wall, where, among the stately trees, you
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
may see two, the Princes' Oaks&mdash;<i>Prinzeneichen</i>&mdash;so
named from an interesting event in Saxon history, of
which we shall perhaps have some particulars by-and-by.
The plateau, moreover, commands views of a fertile and
well-wooded country all broken up by low hills, the
lowest slopes of the Ore mountains&mdash;<i>Erzgebirge</i>&mdash;which
show their dark swelling outlines far away in the south.</p>

<p>You descend suddenly into a gap, which isolates an
eminence&mdash;the hill of Stirling in miniature&mdash;terminating
in a porphyry cliff, crowned by the castle. A convenient
ascent brings you into an irregular court-yard, shut in
on opposite sides by the oldest and newest parts of the
building. Architecture of the thirteenth century mated
curiously with that of the eighteenth; and both occupying
the site of what was already a fortress in the tenth.
The castle owes its present form to the Dukes Friedrich
the Second and Third, who, in 1744, completed their
thirty-eight years of alterations.</p>

<p>The place is a strange medley. Gray, weatherbeaten
walls, with square towers and jutting turrets, intruded
on by modern masonry&mdash;Neptune in his cockle-shell
car in the midst of a fountain, and sentries pacing up
and down, and soldiers lounging about their shabby-looking
quarters&mdash;grim passages, and uncomfortable
chambers. The Austrian arms, which you may yet see
cut in the stone over a doorway, mark the granary built
by the Electress Margaret for stores of corn, in order
that, when grain became dear, she might save the townsfolk
from hunger. A little farther and you come to the
<i>Mantelthurm</i>, a round tower, with walls seven yards
thick, commonly called the <i>Bottle</i>, from the form of its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
slated roof. It has two ugly chambers, which were used
as dungeons up to 1641, after which it did duty as a
magazine; and now the lower part is a cinder-hole.
Adjoining is the <i>Jünkerei</i>&mdash;once the pages' quarters&mdash;in
which are certain official apartments and the armoury.
The Imperialists plundered the castle, during the Thirty
Years' War, of most of its treasures and curiosities; and
later, many specimens of mediæval armour were carried
off to Coburg, leaving little besides objects which have
an intimate relation with Saxon history. Weapons old
and new, banners, garments, paraphernalia used in ducal
funerals, and many things which belonged to persons connected
with the Robbery of the Princes (<i>Prinzenraub</i>).
In recent times a museum of antiquities has been added:
articles of furniture, books, and other rarities which perpetuate
the memory of eminent individuals&mdash;urns and
other funereal remains dug up in the neighbourhood&mdash;ethnographical
specimens chiefly from Australia and the
Sunda Islands&mdash;and a collection of china, presented by
the Minister Baron von Lindenau.</p>

<p>The palace, or modern portion of the castle, dates
from 1706. The castellan will conduct you through
the throne-room, the great hall, where hang life-size
pictures of the dukes on horseback by whom the place
was built, and paintings of historical scenes, and other
apartments bright with gilding and hung with elegant
draperies.</p>

<p>The church, built in the old German style, on the
spot once occupied by the castle chapel, contains banners,
and paintings, and numerous monuments and
tablets to the memory of the princely personages buried
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
beneath, and some admirable specimens of oak carving.
To read their names as you pass along is a lesson in
Saxon genealogy. Among them is that of the Electress
Margaret, whose remains, after a rest of more than three
centuries, were removed to the Princes' Vault, the door
to which, studded with iron stars, you may see in the
nave. But, in 1846, Duke Joseph caused the old tomb
to be cleared out and repaired, and honouring the memory
of her whose name is yet revered in Saxony, had
her coffin restored to its former place with solemn ceremony.</p>

<p>From the balconies or the tower you have a good
view of the town lying beneath on a steep hill-slope,
with its large ponds, and many ups and downs. And
all around lie fields, and gardens, and rich pastures,
bearing fruitful testimony to the good husbandry of the
Wends.</p>

<p>The main approach to the castle is by a road winding
with an easy slope up the steep side of the hill. Its
upper extremity is crowned by a gateway in the Romanesque
style, and where its lower end sinks to the
level of the road stand two obelisks&mdash;pyramids as they
are called&mdash;bearing on their pedestals a statue of Hercules
and Minerva.</p>

<p>The streets were full of life and bustle, for it was
market day, and the Wends coming into the town from
all quarters increased the novelty of the sight by their
singular costume. The men wear a flat cloth cap, a
short tight jacket drawn into plaits behind, and decorated
in front with as many buttons as may be seen
on the breast of a Paddingtonian page, loose baggy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
breeches, and tight boots up to the knee. You will,
perhaps, think it a misfortune that the breeches are not
longer, for all below is spindle-shanky, in somewhat
ludicrous contrast with the amplitude above, and the
broad, big foot. How such a foot finds its way through
so narrow a boot-leg is not easy to guess. The men are
generally tall, with oval faces of a quiet, honest expression.</p>

<p>But the women!&mdash;they are something to wonder at.
Most of them are bareheaded: some wear a close plain
cap, which throws out their round chubby faces in full
relief; some display a curiously padded blue horseshoe,
kept in place by a belt that hides the ears, from which
two red streamers hang down their back; and others
content themselves with a ribbon, tying their hair behind
in a flat wide bow. Their gown is long in the
sleeves and short in the skirt&mdash;short as a Highlander's
kilt, which it very much resembles, and is in most instances
of a carpet-like texture. Plum-colour, blue,
pink, and green, dotted with bright flowers or crossed
by stripes, are the prevailing patterns; their gay tints
relieving the sombre blue and black of the men. The
skirt is made to fit pretty closely, much more so, indeed,
than the men's breeches, and as it descends no lower
than the knee, you can see that if Nature is niggard to
the men she is generous to the women. Such an exhibition
of well-developed legs in blue worsted stockings
I never before witnessed.</p>

<p>Some of the younger ones had put on their summer
stockings of white cotton, and, with bodice and skirt
of different patterns, went strutting about apparently
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
well pleased with themselves. But they have another
peculiarity besides the kilt: they all, young and old,
wear a species of cuirass, secured at the waist and
rising to their chin. I judged it to be made of light
wood, covered with black stuff. It gives them a
grotesque appearance when looked at from the front
or sideways; suggesting an idea of human turtles, or
descendants of a race of Amazons. Some sat at their
stalls with their chin resting on it, or face half hidden
behind; and many times did I notice the breastplate
pushed down to make room for the mouth to open
when the wearer wished to speak&mdash;the pushings down
being not less frequent than the shrugs of ladies in
other places to keep their silly bonnets on. Even little
girls wear the cuirass, and very remarkable objects they
are.</p>

<p>The spacious area of the market-place, enclosed by
antique houses, was thronged. Wendish women sitting
in long rows behind their baskets of cherries and heaps
of vegetables; others arriving with fresh supplies on
low wheelbarrows, their white legs twinkling everywhere
in the sunshine. And many more who had
come to buy roving busily from one wooden booth to
another among all sorts of wares&mdash;books, ironmongery,
jewelry, cakes and confectionery, coarse gray crockery,
tubs and buckets, deep trays and kneading troughs
chopped from one block; but the drapers and haberdashers,
with their stores of gaudy kerchiefs and gay
tartans and piles of stockings, attracted the most numerous
customers. There was a brisk sale of sausages
and bread&mdash;large, flat, round loaves (weighing 12lb.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
English) of black rye bread, at one groschen the pound,
which was considered dear.</p>

<p>The men wandered about among the scythes, rakes,
and wooden shovels, or the stalls of pipes and cutlery,
or gathered round the ricketty wagons laden with
small sacks of grain and meal which were continually
arriving, led by one of the tribe in dusty boots. And
all the while the townsfolk came crowding in to make
their weekly purchases till there was scarcely room to
move.</p>

<p>Such a scene is to me far more interesting than a
picture-gallery. I went to and fro in the throng
hearkening with pleasure to the various voices, watching
the buying and selling, and noting the honest,
cheerful faces of many of the women. Then escaping,
I could survey the whole market-place from the rising
ground at its upper end, and contemplate at leisure the
living picture, framed by houses and shops in the olden
style, among which, on one side, rises the ancient <i>Rathhaus</i>.
It was built in 1562 with the stones of a church
given to the corporation by Duke Johann, whose portrait
you may see hanging in the hall inside among
electors and dukes, and their wives; and, ever since, it
has been used for weddings, dances, and religious meetings,
as well as for the grave business of the council and
police. Opposite the entrance, the date 1770, inserted
with black pebbles into the paving, marks the spot
where the last beheading took place under authority of
the council.</p>

<p>The Wends are the descendants of a Sclavonic tribe,
which, according to ethnologists, migrated from the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
shores of the Adriatic more than a thousand years ago,
carrying in their name (<i>Wend</i> or <i>Wand</i>) a proof of
having once lived by the sea. They are remarkable
for the tenacity of their adherence to ancient habits and
customs, which may, perhaps, account for their still
being a distinct people among the Germans by whom
they are surrounded. And they are not less remarkable
for honesty, health, and an amount of agricultural
skill, which distinguishes them from their neighbours.
They are clever and successful in rearing cattle; they
get on, and save money; and the women have the
reputation of being most excellent nurses. The Bohemian
peasant on the farther side of the mountains used,
if he does not now, when his children were born, to
stretch them out, sometimes at the end of a pole, towards
the country of the Wends, that the infant might
grow up as able and lucky as they. One of their immemorial
practices, still kept up, is to talk to their bees,
and tell them of all household incidents, and especially
of a death in the family. Their number is two hundred
thousand, all within the limits of Lusatia.</p>

<p>A much-frequented promenade is the dam of the
Great Pond&mdash;<i>Grossen Teich</i>&mdash;on the southern side of the
town, which, planted with chestnuts and limes, forms a
series of green and shady alleys, with a pleasant prospect
across gardens and meadows to the village of
Altendorf. Swans glide about on the surface of the
water, which covers sixteen acres, and a gondola plies
to a small wooded island in the centre, resorted to by
lovers and picnic parties. A short distance northwards
lies the Little Pond, bordered by rows of poplars, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
three other ponds in different parts of the town are also
made to contribute to its attractions.</p>

<p>Another pleasure-ground is the "Plateau," on an
eminence between the railway station and the road to
Leipzig, from which you may wander through shady
alleys to the old ruin of Alexisburg. The cemetery, on
a hill to the west of the town, is worth a visit for a
sight of some of the tombs, among which appears the
entrance to the new Princes' Vault, constructed in
1837, in the form of a small chapel, lighted by richly-stained
glass windows, through the floor of which the
coffins are lowered to the vault beneath. On St.
John's Day the cemetery is thronged by the townsfolk,
decorating the graves of their departed friends with
flowers.</p>

<p>After a visit to all these places, and a peep into the
two churches in which Luther once preached&mdash;the
Bartholomäikirche and the Brüderkirche&mdash;I travelled
on to Zwickau, and as there is little to be seen on the
way besides fields, low hills, and the tall-chimneyed,
smoking, stocking-weaving town of Werdau, we will
glance at an interesting event in Saxon history incidentally
alluded to in the foregoing pages.

</p>

<p class="p2">Wends had long peopled the Pleissengau when
King Henry I.&mdash;the Fowler, as his contemporaries
named him&mdash;conquered it during one of his many
inroads among his neighbours, and made it part of the
<i>Osterland</i> early in the tenth century. The newly-won
territory was soon settled by German colonists, who,
finding an ancient fortification on the summit of a bluff,
rocky hill, called it <i>alte Burg</i>, whence the present name
of the town and principality of Altenburg. Henry, or
his successor, Otho, built a castle on the hill, no portion
of which, or of the one which replaced it, now remains.
The town is first mentioned in a document of the year
986. Its story is the old one: family feud, rapine and
revenge, chivalry and heroism, intermingled with quaint
and quiet glimpses of social life, characteristic of the
"dark ages." Earliest among its possessors were the
Hohenstaufens; latest are the Hildburghausens. At
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">26</a></span>
one time it was imperial; at another independent; now
pledged or given away by an emperor; now held by a
duke. In 1286 its prosperity was such that the burghers
went carried in sedan-chairs to the council-house, and
their wives walked to church festivals on carpets spread
before them in the street.</p>

<p>Six years later Friedrich the Bitted quarrelled with
Adolf von Nassau for having pledged Altenburg to
King Wenzel of Bohemia; whereupon Adolf invited
Friedrich to a Christmas feast, and while he sat at
table employed a ruffian to murder him, as the speediest
way of settling the dispute. The blow, however,
fell on the wrist of a burgher of Freiberg who rushed
between, and lost his hand in preventing the crime.
Friedrich escaped, changed his dress, and, under cover
of night, fled the city; but, having gained a battle in
the interval, he returned as ruler in 1307. The scene
of this malignant assault is supposed to have been a
house in the market-place.</p>

<p>Then came a succession of Friedrichs: the Earnest,
the Strong, the Warlike, the Quarrelsome, the Mild,
and such like. It was in 1430, during the lifetime
of the last mentioned, that those fierce Reformers, the
Hussites, came across the mountains and made an inroad
into the principality. They chose Three-Kings'
Day for their attack on the town, which was abandoned
to them by the inhabitants, who fled to neighbouring
villages, or took refuge in the castle; and,
having burnt and plundered to the satisfaction of their
cupidity or their conscience during four days, they left
the place to recover as best it might.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span></p>

<p>The same Elector, Friedrich the Mild, married the
Austrian Princess Margaret&mdash;fit wife for such a prince,
if we may judge from her endeavours to prevent bread
becoming too dear for the townsfolk.</p>

<p>Luther was in Altenburg from the 3rd to the 9th
of January, 1519, to hold a conference with Karl von
Miltitz, the papal legate. The two met in the house of
George Spalatin, who became a firm friend of the great
Reformer. Luther visited the town also when on his
famous journey to Worms, and on several occasions
afterwards.</p>

<p>The council-house was the scene of a religious conference
from October, 1568, to March of the following
year. The parties in presence were&mdash;the theologians
of Electoral Saxony on the one hand, of Ducal Saxony
on the other; and among the subjects mooted they
discussed the questions, "Whether good works were
needful for salvation?" and, "Whether man can co-operate
in the attainment of his own salvation?" and
with the usual result; for the disputants separated without
coming to a decision.</p>

<p>The old town suffered from the disasters and commotions
of the Peasants' War. The Imperialists quartered
themselves upon it after the fatal battle of Lützen. The
troubles of the Seven Years' War fell upon it, and of
the campaigns that ended in the downfall of Napoleon.
In 1810, the French commissioners seized a quantity of
English manufactures in possession of resident merchants,
and made a great bonfire therewith in the market-place.
In 1813, the Emperors of Austria and Russia and the
King of Prussia visited the town, and in the same year
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
it afforded quarters to 671 generals, 46,617 officers, and
472,399 ordinary troops.</p>

<p>Now we must go back for awhile to the year 1455,
the times of Friedrich the Mild. On the night of the
6th of July in that year the Electress Margaret, his
wife, dreamt that two young oaks, growing in a forest
near the castle, were torn up by a wild boar. Herein
her maternal heart foreboded danger to the two princes
Ernest and Albert, both still in their boyhood. The
times were indeed disquieting, what with Hussite wars,
territorial quarrels, and the ominous foretokens of the
coming Reformation. Mild as Friedrich was, he, too,
had had some fighting with his brother, Duke Wilhelm,
about their lands. Among his officers was a certain
Conrad, or, as he was commonly called, Kunz von
Kauffungen, formerly captain of the castle, who, through
disappointment, had come to entertain two causes of
quarrel against his master. One was that, having been
sent to surprise and capture Gera, he was taken himself,
and only recovered his liberty by payment of four thousand
florins ransom. Of this sum Kunz claimed reimbursement
from the Elector, and met with denial. The
second was, a demand for the restoration of estates of
which he had been granted temporary possession, but
which, defying legal authorities, he refused to give up
until the coveted four thousand florins should be once
more in his pocket. Chafing under his twofold grievance,
he broke out into threats of reprisal, to which Friedrich
answered jocularly, "Don't burn the fish in the ponds."</p>

<p>Baffled and exasperated, Kunz devised a scheme for
bringing the question to a speedy issue: persuaded Hans
Schwalbe, one of the scullions at the castle, into his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
interest; concerted measures with his brother Dietrich
von Kauffungen, Wilhelm von Mosen, and others, thirty-seven
altogether, and watched his opportunity.</p>

<p>Treacherous Schwalbe failed not in the service required
of him, and gave information of the Elector's
absence: called away by affairs to Leipzig. Whereupon
Kunz and his confederates, mounting to horse, rode to
Altenburg, and halted under cover of a wood&mdash;where
now the pleasure-ground is laid out at the foot of the
castle&mdash;between eleven and twelve in the night of the
7th of July. Finding all quiet, he sent his body-servant,
Hans Schweinitz, forward to fix a rope ladder, with
Schwalbe's help, at a window above the steepest side of
the rock, and, following with Mosen, the two climbed
up and got into the castle. Once in, they hastened to
the chamber of the young princes, and each seizing one,
made their way to the gate. But, instead of Albert, the
little Count Barby had been picked up. Kunz was no
sooner aware of the mistake, than, giving Ernest, whom
he carried, into Mosen's arms, he hurried back with the
terrified count, and brought out Albert. Quicker, however,
than the robbery was the spread of an alarm. The
Electress, apprehensive, perhaps, because of her dream on
the previous night, appeared at a window, imploring
Kunz to restore her children, and promising to intercede
with the Elector in favour of his demands. Her entreaties
and lamentations fell on deaf ears; Mosen had
already made good his retreat, and Kunz speedily followed
him through the gate, which was easily opened,
there being but a single invalid on guard. The time
was singularly favourable for the success of the plot, as
nearly all the residents and functionaries were enjoying
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
themselves at a feast given by the Chancellor in the
town.</p>

<p>The alarm-bell began to ring. Mosen and the others
galloped off with their prize, and Kunz, mounting his
horse with young Albert before him, and attended by
Schweinitz, lost no time in making for the frontier. If
Isenburg could be reached before the pursuers came up,
the game would be in his own hands. On they went in
the dim night through the Rabensteiner Forest, along
rugged and darksome ways, where they wandered from
the track, their horses stumbled or floundered in miry
holes, forced to choose the wildest and least-frequented
routes, for dogs were barking and alarm-bells ringing in
all the villages, warning honest folk that knaves were
abroad. The dewy morning dawned, birds twittered
among the branches, the sun arose, daylight streamed
into the forests, and still the fugitives urged their panting
horses onwards. A few hours later the young prince,
worn out by want of rest and the increasing heat, complained
of thirst; whereupon Kunz, though still a half-score
miles from the Bohemian frontier, halted not far
from the village of Elterlein, and crept about in the
wood to pluck berries for the boy's refreshment. While
the captain was thus occupied, a certain charcoal-burner&mdash;George
Schmidt by name&mdash;at work near the spot,
attracted by the glint of armour between the trees, approached
the halting-place, made suspicious, perhaps,
by the alarm-bells. To his surprise, he saw horses
showing marks of hasty travel, and a fair-haired boy
well attired, who said at once, "I am the young prince.
They have stolen me." No sooner spoken than the
<i>Köhler</i>, running up to Kunz, who was still stooping
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
over the berries, felled him with a blow of the stout pole
which he used in tending his fires. A shout brought up
a gang of his comrades, sturdy fellows with long hair
and grimy faces, who promptly laid hold of Kunz and
Schweinitz, bound their hands, and carried them off for
safe keeping to the neighbouring monastery of Grünhain.
Thither also was the young Albert borne in friendly
arms, and from thence, on the following day, an escort,
among whom went the <i>Köhler</i>, conducted him back to
his weeping mother&mdash;a real triumphal procession by the
time they arrived at Altenburg.</p>

<p>Mosen and his troop, meanwhile, had betaken themselves
to a hiding-place not far from the castle of Stein,
on the right bank of the Mulde, about half way towards
the frontier. While some made good their retreat to
secret quarters, the principals concealed themselves with
Prince Ernest in a rocky cave screened by trees, waiting
for a favourable opportunity to renew their flight.
But hearing, while on their look-out, sundry passers-by
talk of the capture of unlucky Kunz, they sent a messenger
to Friedrich von Schonburg at Hartenstein,
offering to deliver up the prince on condition that they
should be left free to depart unmolested. The condition
was granted: they gave up their captive, and were seen
no more in all the province; and Schonburg conveyed
Ernest to Chemnitz, where he was received by his father
the Elector.</p>

<p>Unlucky Kunz having been carefully escorted to
Freiberg, was there beheaded on the 14th of July&mdash;an
example to knightly kidnappers. On the next day the
<i>Köhler's</i> homely gaberdine and the garments of the
princes were hung up in the church at Ebersdorf, not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
far from the scene of the rescue. As for the <i>Köhler</i>
himself, he had but to speak his wishes, for the Electress,
in the joy of her heart at the restoration of her sons,
could not sufficiently reward the man who had saved
the younger. "I worried them right well"&mdash;(<i>wohl getrillt</i>)&mdash;he
said, when recounting how he had laid about
him with his pole at the time of the rescue; and ever
afterwards was he known as the <i>Triller</i>. His wishes
were modest enough;&mdash;a little bit of land, and liberty
to hunt and cut wood in the forest&mdash;and amply were
they gratified.</p>

<p>Such is in brief the story of the <i>Prinzenraub</i>, as it
happened four hundred years ago&mdash;a memorable event
in Saxon history. A walled-up window in the castle
at Altenburg, on the side towards the Pauritzer Pond, is
said to indicate the place where in the former building
the robbers entered. The Princes' Oaks still flourish;
and the cave in which Ernest was hidden is still known
as the <i>Prinzenhöhle</i>. And our own history is involved
in the event, for from that same Ernest descends the
Consort of our Queen.</p>

<p>To most English readers the <i>Prinzenraub</i> was an unknown
story until a few years ago, when Thomas Carlyle
published it from his vigorous pen in the <i>Westminster
Review</i>, where all the circumstances are brought before
us in the very vividness of life. "Were I touring in
those parts, I would go and see," says the author, referring
to the rumour that the estate bestowed on the
<i>Triller</i> remained still in possession of his posterity. By
inquiry at Altenburg, I learned that this estate lay in
the neighbourhood of Zwickau, so, as I also was bound
for the Bohemian frontier, I did go and see on the way.

</p>

<p class="p2">The dark roofs of a few dull streets, a lofty old
church tower, the tall chimneys, and clouds of steam
and smoke of a busy suburb, rising amid orchards,
gardens, and hop-grounds in the pleasant and thickly-wooded
valley of the Mulde, are the features presented
by Zwickau as you approach it from the terminus.
There needs no long research to discover that the
<i>Prinzenraub</i> is a household word among the people:
hanging on the wall in the hotel you may see engravings
of the <i>Prinzenhöhle</i>, the castle of Stein, the monastery
at Grünhain, and other places incidental to the robbery;
and the waiters are ready to tell you that the Triller
estate lies near Eckersbach, about half an hour's walk to
the east of the town.</p>

<p>On my way thither I crossed the Mulde, a lively
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
stream, flowing between steep slopes of trees, broken
here and there by a red fern-fringed cliff. A Saxon
liking&mdash;one which the Anglo-Saxon has not forgotten&mdash;is
betrayed in the name of the bridge&mdash;Beer Bridge;
it leads to Beer Mount, which conceals within its cool
and dark interior countless barrels of the national
beverage. While walking up the hollow road that
winds round the hill, you see on one side the entrances
to the deeply excavated cellars, on the other a tavern,
overshadowed by linden-trees, offering refreshing temptations
to the thirsty visitor.</p>

<p>The road presently rising across open fields brings
you in sight of a pile of huge bright-red brick buildings,
erected on the farther side of a deep, narrow dell, contrasting
well with the green of a cherry orchard and
woods in the rear. There lies the <i>Triller</i> estate. Times
are changed; and where the sinewy <i>Köhler</i> tilled his
field and reared his family, now stands a brewery&mdash;<i>Triller
Bierbrauerei</i>. The wakeful genius of trade has
taken possession, and finds in the patriotic sentiment
inspired by the history of the place a handsome source
of profit.</p>

<p>I addressed myself to the <i>Braumeister</i>&mdash;<i>Brewmaster</i>&mdash;who
on hearing that one of England's foremost authors
had published the story of the <i>Prinzenraub</i>, manifested
a praiseworthy readiness to satisfy my curiosity.
The estate had long been out of the hands of the <i>Triller</i>
family, so long that he could not remember the time&mdash;perhaps
fifty years. But the <i>Trillers</i> were not extinct:
one was living at Freiberg, and two others elsewhere in
Saxony. The place now belongs to a company, under
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
whose management <i>Triller</i> beer has become famous in
all the country round; and not undeservedly, as I from
experience am prepared to affirm. There is a large
garden, with paths winding among the trees, and open
places bestrewn with tables and chairs enough for the
innumerable guests who quench their thirst at the
brewery.</p>

<p>As we strolled about the premises, the <i>Braumeister</i>
called my attention to a writing over the main entrance&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p><i>Dulcius ex ipso fonte bibuntur aquæ</i>,</p>
</div></div>

<p>remarking that he had never known a visitor disposed
to quarrel with it. Then, abandoning his laconic phrases,
he told me how the four hundredth anniversary of the
<i>Prinzenraub</i> had been celebrated on the 8th of July,
1855. It was a day to be remembered in all the places
made historic by the event. From Schedewitz, on the
farther side of Zwickau, a long procession had walked
to the Brewery, under triumphal arches erected on the
way. First came a troop of Coalers, in forest garb, then
friends of the company on foot and in wagons, and
bands of music; altogether eight hundred persons, and
among them the three <i>Trillers</i>. Airs were played and
songs sung that made all the fire of patriotism glow
again; and so earnestly did the multitude enter into the
spirit of the celebration, that&mdash;a merry twinkle gleamed
in the <i>Braumeister's</i> eye as he told it&mdash;"They drank a
hundred eimers of beer. There they are: look at them,"
he added, pointing to an engraving of the whole procession&mdash;the
<i>Trillerzug</i>, as he called it.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span></p>

<p>A similar festival was held at Altenburg, Hartenstein,
and Grünhain on the same day, to the entire satisfaction
of all concerned, and the reinvigoration of Saxon
loyalty.</p>

<p>I was seated at one of the tables with a tankard of
beer before me, when a young man came up, looked at
me inquisitively, and said, "E shmall Eng-lish speak"&mdash;meaning,
"I speak a little English."</p>

<p>I felicitated him on his acquirements, when he proceeded
to tell me that he was one of the clerks employed
in the counting-house, and having heard of my arrival
from the <i>Braumeister</i>, could not resist the desire of
speaking with an Englishman. Moreover, he would
like to show me certain things which I had not yet
seen, and he said, "If you pleasure in <i>Prinzenraub</i> find,
so is glad to me."</p>

<p>We were friends in a moment. He led me first to
the counting-house, and showed me the bust of Herr
Ebert, who, as chief proprietor, had headed the procession
in the former year, but was since deceased, saying,
"We very, very sorry; every man love him. Ah! he
was so good." Then running up-stairs to a large whitewashed
apartment&mdash;one of the drinking-rooms used
when guests are driven in-doors by bad weather&mdash;where
a few portraits hung on the walls, he cried, "Here is
something to see. But wait&mdash;you will have a tsigger?"</p>

<p>"With pleasure," I answered, "if it's good to drink."</p>

<p>"No, not drink," he replied. "What you call him?&mdash;to
shmoke."</p>

<p>The room echoed with my laugh, and he prolonged
it, as I rejoined, "Oh! you mean a cigar! No, thank
you. Tobacco is one of the things I abhor."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">37</a></span></p>

<p>"What you call him?" he exclaimed, in amazement&mdash;"cigar!
Then what for a teacher is mine. But he
is a German."</p>

<p>Our friendly relations were in no way deranged by
my dislike of a "tsigger;" and we turned to the portraits,
which comprised some of the personages involved
in the <i>Prinzenraub</i>. The brave old <i>Triller</i> is represented
in the costume of the period&mdash;a stalwart fellow,
with ample black beard, bare legs, broad-brimmed hat,
and loose frock tied by a belt round the waist. In one
hand he grasps his pole, with the other supports the
prince, who wearing red hosen and peaked red boots,
looks up to him with tearful eye. Kunz appears lying
down in the background, looking half-stunned and
miserable. There are two miniatures&mdash;of the <i>Triller</i>
and his wife&mdash;apparently very old, believed to be likenesses.
In the excitement occasioned by the four
hundredth anniversary, a poor shoemaker, hearing it
talked of, came to the brewery with the paintings in his
hand, and sold the two for a shilling. Besides these
there are seven or eight other portraits, among which
the features of Kunz impress you favourably. He has
dark curly hair, a high forehead, a clear bright eye,
moustache and pointed beard; the whole appearance
and expression reminding you of Sir Philip Sidney.</p>

<p>What with fluent German and broken English the
young clerk worked himself into enthusiasm, and
showed me everything that had the remotest connexion
with the subject, ending with a book containing the
latest history of the <i>Prinzenraub</i>, and engravings of its
incidents. Nor could he think of letting me depart till
I had seen the whole premises, and the enormous cellars.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span></p>

<p>"The <i>Triller</i> is a good name for the brewery," he said,
as we paced between the furlongs of barrels.</p>

<p>On my return to the town I found out the ancient
dame who keeps the key of the church tower, and
as she unlocked the door offered her a small silver coin.
"No! no! no!" she exclaimed, "that is too much. A
<i>Dreier</i> (halfpenny) is enough for me." A rare instance
of disinterestedness. Once admitted, you find your way
alone up to the topmost chamber, where dwells a woman
with two or three children. She was winding up from
the street below her daily supply of water when I
entered out of breath with the ascent of so many steps,
and paused in her task to conduct me to the platform, a
height of about two hundred feet, from which the
steeple springs one hundred and fifty feet higher. Wide
and remarkable is the prospect: the rows of poplars
which border the roads leading on all sides from the
town divide the landscape into segments with stiff
lines that produce a singular effect as they diminish
gradually in thickness and vanish in the distance.
Plenty of wood all around, merging towards the south
into the vast fir forest which there darkens the long
swells and rounded summits of the <i>Erzgebirge</i>: a
region of contrasts, with its abounding fertility and
unpicturesque foundries and mining-works. The town
appears to better advantage from above than below, for
the many green spots in the rear of the houses come into
the view, and you see gleaming curves of the Mulde,
and a great pond as at Altenburg, and the remains of
the old walls, and the ditches, now in part changed into
a garden promenade.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span></p>

<p>The mind becomes interested as well as the eye. You
may grow dreamy over the fabulous adventures of the
fair Princess Schwanhildis, in whose adventures, as
implied in hoary tradition, the place originated; and if
you desire proof, is it not found in the three swans, still
borne in the town arms? Or you may revert to the
sixth century only, when the Wends had a colony here,
and worshipped Zwicz, one of their Sclavish fire-gods
in the <i>Aue</i>, or meadow&mdash;whence the present name,
Zwickau. Or you may remember that Luther often
mounted the tower to gaze on the widespread view;
and imagine him contemplating the scenes on which
your eye now rests&mdash;a brief pause in his mighty work
of rescuing Europe from the toils of priestcraft. A
clumsy table yet remaining on the platform, though
tottering and fallen on one side with age and weakness,
is called "Luther's table;" the great Reformer
having, as is said, once sat by it to eat. But the sentiment
which such a relic should inspire is weakened
by the inference that as the Zwickauers take no pains
to preserve it from the weather, they at least are sceptical
concerning its merits.</p>

<p>And the church itself. It is the largest, the finest
specimen of Gothic, and has the biggest bell, in all
Saxony, and excepting two towers in Dresden, is the
highest. It dates from the eleventh century, and has
been more than once restored. The interior well repays
a visit. The slender, eight-sided pillars of the
nave, the rare carvings of the bench-ends, and others
about the choir and confessional, and in the sacristy,
the high altar, by Wohlgemuth, of Nuremberg, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
only one remaining of twenty-five which formerly
stood around the walls, raise your admiration of art.
If curious in such matters, you may see a splinter of
the true cross&mdash;a relic from Popish times&mdash;still preserved.
There are some good paintings, of which one
by Lucas Cranach the Younger represents Jesus as
"Children's Friend." It was painted at the cost of a
burgomaster in honour of his wife's memory.</p>

<p>For one with time at discretion, Zwickau and the
neighbourhood would yield a few days of enjoyable
exploration. A remarkable instance of volcanic action
is to be seen between Planitz and Niederkainsdorf,
which has existed from time immemorial. Steam is
continually bursting up from the coal strata beneath,
of so high a temperature that the ground is always
green even in the hardest winters. An attempt was
made, a few years ago, to utilize the heat by establishing
a forcing-garden on the spot; and in the adjacent
forests there are land-slips, produced by disturbances of
the strata, which are described as romantic in their
effects. The valley of the Mulde offers much pleasing
scenery; the castle of Stein and the <i>Prinzenhöhle</i>
are within half a day's walk; and somewhat farther
are the singular rocks at Greifenstein, a pile as of huge
beds petrified. The legend runs that a princess, having
married while her betrothed, whom she had promised
never to forget, was absent, the fairies, exercising their
right of punishment, turned her and all her household
gear into stone, and the beds remain to commemorate
the perfidy. There are, besides, baths and mineral
springs at the village of Oberkainsdorf, and at Hohensteiner
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
Bad; and curious old carvings in the castle of
Schönfels; and, if you incline to geology, the coal
measures abound in fossil plants and shells, while of
minerals there is no stint.</p>

<p>The town has attractions of another sort: early-printed
books, rare manuscripts, original letters by
Luther and other Reformers, in the Library; the
<i>Rathhaus</i>, on the front of which, over the door, you
may see the three swans; and, among the archives,
more letters by Luther and Melancthon. There are
portraits of the two, by Cranach, in the neighbouring
castle of Planitz. The house, No. 22, in the market-place,
is that in which Luther lodged in 1522; Melancthon
sojourned in No. 444, in the <i>Burggasse</i>; and
No. 576, in the <i>Schergasse</i>, is where Napoleon had his
quarters in 1812.</p>

<p>It was evening when I slung on my knapsack and
began my walk in earnest. A short stage at the outset
is no bad preparation for the work to follow. The
road runs between the noisy factories, past vitriol
works, smelting furnaces, and, thick with dust, is, for
the first three or four miles, far from pleasant. At
length the busy district is left behind, the trees bordering
the highway look greener, and the river, separated
but by a narrow strip of meadow, is near enough for its
rippling to be heard. Excepting a miner now and
then, wearing his short leathern hinder-apron, and a
general shabbiness of dress, the people I met might
have been mistaken for English, so marked is the similarity
of form and feature. Transported suddenly to
any of the roads leading out of Birmingham, no one
would have imagined them to be foreigners.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span></p>

<p>About three hours, at an easy pace, brought me to a
wayside public-house near Oberhaselau, where I halted
for the night. There were sundry rustic folk among
the guests, one of whom told me, while I ate my
supper, that he had taken part in the <i>Prinzenraub</i>
celebration, along with hundreds of foresters and villagers,
at a <i>Wirthshaus</i> built on the spot where the
<i>Triller's</i> cabin stood&mdash;a day to be remembered as long
as he lived. He had, moreover, seen the <i>Triller's</i>
gaberdine hanging in the monastery at Ebersdorf.</p>

<p>Later in the evening came in three men of dignified
appearance, who sat down at a card-table in one corner,
to a game of what might be described as three-handed
whist. Gustel, the maid, showed them much deference,
and placed before each a quart-glass of beer. They
were, she whispered to me, the <i>Actuarius</i> of the village,
and the Inspector and Doctor. From time to time,
during the game, they broke out into a rattling peal of
laughter, as one of them threw a set of dice on the
table and handed round a few extra cards. I requested
permission to look at the cause of merriment, and, to
my amazement, discovered that both cards and dice
were disgustingly obscene, out of all character with the
respectable appearance of their possessors.</p>

<p>Before the game was over, some six or eight
wagoners, who had arrived with their teams, spread
bundles of straw on the floor, pulled off their boots
with a ponderous boot-jack chained to the door-post,
and, stretching themselves on their lair, soon united in
a discord of snores.

</p>

<p class="p2">The road crosses the Mulde near Oberhaselau, and,
winding onwards between broad, undulating fields, and
through patches of forest, rises gradually, though with
frequent ups and downs, into a region more and more
hilly. A bareness of aspect increases on the landscape
as you advance, in contrast with which the stripes and
squares of cultivation on the slopes appear of shining
greenness. The views grow wider. They are peculiar
and striking, though deficient in beauty, for the range
of the <i>Erzgebirge</i>, as the name indicates, hides its
wealth underground, and makes up by store of mineral
treasure for poverty of surface. Yet, is there not a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
charm in the tamest of mountain scenery? It animated
me as I walked along on that bright sunshiny morning.
Though the river was far out of sight, were there not a
few ponds gleaming in the hollows? while little brooks
ran tinkling down their unseen channels, and fountains
began to appear at the wayside with a ceaseless sound
of bubbling and splashing that fell gratefully on the
ear; and the breeze made a gladsome rustling among
the birches that flung their graceful shadows across the
dusty road. Nature is kind to him who goes on foot,
and makes him aware of beauties and delights never
discovered to the traveller on wheels.</p>

<p>There are signs of a numerous population: church
spires and villages in the distance&mdash;among them Reichenbach
and its ruined castle&mdash;and in little valleys which
branch off here and there, teeming with foliage, snug
cottages thickly nestled; and as your eye wanders along
the broken line of tree-tops, it sees many wavy columns
of smoke betraying the site of rural homes scattered beneath.
And you begin to notice something unfamiliar
in the dress of the people who inhabit them: blue and
red petticoats are frequent, and scarcely a man but wears
the straight tight-legged boots up to the knee, all black
and brightly polished; for the groups I met were on
their way to church. The honest English style of
countenance still prevails; and another English characteristic
may be seen, if you look for it, in the decayed
and illegible condition of the finger-posts.</p>

<p>If the landscape be not picturesque, many of the
houses are, with their timbers, forming zigzags, angles,
squares, diamonds, and other fanciful conceits. Some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
old and gray, assimilating in colour to the weather-stained
masonry; some painted black in strong relief
upon a pale-red wall. While pausing to examine the
details, you will not fail to admire the taste and
skill of the builders of three centuries ago, who knew
how to impart beauty even to the humblest habitations.
Now and then you come upon a house of
which the upper storey, faced with slates, appears as if
supported by arches and pilasters fashioned in the wall
beneath; and specimens of these several kinds of architecture
gratify the eye in all the hill-country of Saxony.</p>

<p>Schneeberg, lying in a valley backed by a dark slope
of firs, has a singularly gloomy aspect, which disappears
as you descend the hill. It was eleven on Sunday
morning when I entered the town. Because summer
had come, the street lamps were all taken down; but
that the chains and ropes might not hang idle, the lamplighter
had tied a big stone or large brick, by no means
ornamental, to the end of every one. A military band
was playing in the market-place; a few shops were open;
and a man hurrying from corner to corner was posting
up bills of plays to be acted in the evening&mdash;a little
comedy, followed by a piece in five acts. The prices
were, for the first places, 6d., the second, 3d., the third,
2d., which would hardly exclude even the poorest. So,
in Saxony, as elsewhere on the Continent, not only
Papists but Protestants are willing to recreate themselves
with music and the theatre on a Sunday. A
half-dozen postilions, who were strutting about in the
full blaze of bright-yellow coats, yellow-banded hats,
jack-boots, and with a bugle slung from the shoulder,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
seemed as proud of their dress as the peacocky drum-major
did of his.</p>

<p>I ordered a steak at the <i>Fürstenhaus</i>. "Will you
have it through-broiled or English-broiled?" asked the
waiter, and looked a little surprised at my preference of
the former. When the band stopped playing, numbers
of the listeners came into the dining-room for a <i>Halbe</i>
of beer, and sat down to play at cards.</p>

<p>The church, a spacious edifice, crowns the height
above the market-place. After walking twice round it,
I discovered a small door in an angle, which being unfastened
gave me admittance. The interior, with its
worn and uneven brick floor, has somewhat of a neglected
look, not unusual in Protestant churches; but there are
a few good paintings, and the altar-piece, representing
the Crucifixion, shows the hand of a master. I was
quite alone, and could explore as I pleased. The altar
rises to a great height, adorned with statues, and crowned
by figures of angels. Near it two or three tall crucifixes
lean against the wall; the font, and a lectern upborne by
an angel stand in the centre of the nave, and everywhere
are signs of the Lutheran form of worship. Here
and there, constructed with an apparent disregard of
order, are glazed galleries, pews, and closets, and others
that resemble large cages&mdash;ugly excrescences, which mar
the fair proportions of the lofty nave. The gallery is
fronted by a thick breastwork of masonry, bearing a
heavy coping, and the brick floor is in many places worn
completely through, and the loose lumps are strewn
about. The view from the tower, commanding miles of
the mountain range, more than repays the trouble of the
ascent.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span></p>

<p>There are three services on the Sunday. From six
to seven, and from eight to half-past nine in the morning,
and from one to two in the afternoon. The rest of
the day is free; but not for work, as in other countries.
Haymaking, as I was informed, is the only Sunday
work permitted by the law of Saxony. The Sunday
school is well attended, and is not confined to religious
subjects, for writing, arithmetic, and drawing are
taught.</p>

<p>While trudging up the hill beyond the town, I passed
one of the springless country wagons, crammed with a
military band, the fiddles and big bass viol hanging behind,
on the way to amuse the folk at Stein with music.
They undertake a similar expedition every Sunday in
fine weather to one or other of the surrounding
villages.</p>

<p>I met with two novel experiences during the afternoon.
One was, that to sit down in the church at
Neustädl is a penance, for the pews are so narrow that
you have to lift up the hinged seat before you can enter.
The other, a few miles farther on the way, was of a surly
<i>Wirth</i>, dwelling under the sign of the <i>Weisses Lamm</i>
(White Lamb), whom I begged to draw me a glass of
beer cool from the cellar. Instead of complying, he
filled the measure from a can which had been standing
two or three hours on the dresser in all the suffocating
heat of the stove, and placed it before me with a grunt.
I ventured to remind him, with good-humoured words,
that lukewarm beer was not acceptable to a thirsty wayfarer
on a hot day; whereupon he retorted, snarling
more like a wolf than a lamb, "Either drink that, or go
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">48</a></span>
and get other where the pepper grows"&mdash;<i>wo der Pfeffer
wächst</i>.</p>

<p>The old sinner availed himself of a form of speech
much used among the Germans to denote a place of
intensely high temperature, and sulphureous withal, in
which pepper, being so very pungent a product, may
be supposed to grow.</p>

<p>"Suppose you go first," I answered, "and see if there
be any left." And turning away, I shut the door upon
the snarl which he snarled after me, and went on to
Eybenstock, where cool beer in plenty was forthcoming
as soon as asked for.</p>

<p>I told the hostess of my adventure with old Surly.
"Just like him," she replied, laughing merrily; "nobody
ever goes to the <i>White Lamb</i> that can help it.
You didn't see any one besides him in the room, I'll
engage." True enough, I did not.</p>

<p>A long, steep acclivity rises between Schneeberg and
Eybenstock, from which you look down into deep, dark
gulfs of fir forest, and away to hills swelling higher and
higher in the distance&mdash;all alike sombre. So that when
you come to a green vale, with its little hay-fields
watered by a noisy brook, streaked in places with foam,
it appears lovely by contrast. The road makes long
curves and zigzags to avoid the heights, but the old
track through the trees still remains, and shortens the
distance at the expense of a little exertion in climbing.</p>

<p>The wildness increases beyond Eybenstock. The
forest descends upon the road, and you walk for an hour
at a stretch under the shade of firs, with beech and
birch sparsely intermingled, and here and there a stately
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
pine springing from a mighty base to a height far above
the rest, the topmost branches edged with gold by the
declining sunbeams.</p>

<p>Emerging from the grateful shade, we come to
Wildenthal, a little green hollow at the foot of the
Auersberg, enclosing a saw-mill, a school, a few cottages,
fields and gardens, and an inn, <i>Gasthaus zum
Ross</i>. Great slopes of firs rising on every side shut it
out, as it were, from the rest of the world. The aged
hostess at the <i>Gasthaus</i> bustled about with surprising
alacrity to answer the calls of her rustic guests for beer.
"<i>Einfach</i>," cried one; another, "<i>Weisses</i>;" "<i>Lager</i>,"
broke in a voice from among the party of card-players,
accompanied by a rapping of the pewter tankard-lid;
"<i>Bayerisches</i>," shouted others from the ninepin-alley
outside; and she, with her ready "<i>Gleich</i>"&mdash;directly&mdash;appeasing
their impatience.</p>

<p>Of these four kinds of beer, the first&mdash;literally Simple&mdash;is
equivalent to our small-beer, and is much in request
by a certain class of topers from its low price, and because
they can drink it the whole day without fear of
becoming stupid before the evening. The second&mdash;White&mdash;is
very foamy, and has somewhat the lively
flavour of ginger-beer: after standing some time in the
glass a shake round revives its briskness. The third&mdash;Store-beer&mdash;is
of sufficient strength to bear a year's
keeping; and the fourth&mdash;Bavarian&mdash;is of a similar
quality. The last two were the most to my liking.</p>

<p>There was greater choice of beer than of viands; and
the half-bent old dame thought fit to apologise because
she could give me nothing for supper but omelettes and
<i>Klese</i>; the latter a sort of dumpling made of potatoes
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
and a sprinkling of wheaten flour. "If she had only
known," and so forth. However, I found them palatable,
and ate heartily, and therein she took comfort. Many
times did I eat of such dumplings afterwards, for the
relish for them is not confined to Saxony. Under the
name of <i>Knädeln</i>, or <i>Kipfeln</i>, they are a standing dish
among the Bohemians. To hundreds of families in the
<i>Erzgebirge</i> they are the only variety&mdash;but without the
wheaten flour&mdash;in a perpetual potato diet: rarely can
they get even the sour black bread of the country, and
in the years of the potato disease famine and misery
desolated many a hearth.</p>

<p>The guests went away early, and then, as twilight
fell, nothing disturbed the stillness of the vale save the
murmur of running water and the whisper of the breeze
among the slopes of firs, inviting to a contemplative
stroll.</p>

<p>I rose on the morrow soon after the sun, and
scrambled up the Auersberg. It was really a scramble,
for I pushed at a venture into the forest, aiming direct
for the summit. How the grass and the diminutive
black-eared rye glistened with dewdrops! Early as it
was, the saw-mill had begun its busy clatter, and here
and there on the hills the woodcutters' strokes sounded
in the calm morning air. Once under the trees all signs
of a track disappeared; and there were slopes slippery
with decayed vegetation; little swamps richly carpeted
with exquisite mosses; dense patches of bilberry, teeming
with berries as purple ripe as when Kunz plucked in
another part of the forest but a few miles distant. And
after all, owing to the tower on the top having fallen
down, and the trees having grown up, the view is
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
limited to a narrow opening on either side, where an
avenue, now rarely used, affords an easy though tedious
ascent. A square block of stone stands near the remains
of the tower, dedicated to an upper forest-master, who
had fulfilled fifty years of service, by his friends and
subordinates. However, there is such a charm in the
wild, lonely forest, that one need not regret half an
hour's exertion in scrambling up a steep hill under its
shadow.</p>

<p>I amused myself during breakfast with the <i>Erzgebirgischer
Anzeiger</i>, a small quarto newspaper, published
at Schneeberg thrice a week; the price twelve <i>neugroschen</i>
(about fifteen pence) per quarter. Beer and
amusements occupied a large space among the advertisements;
for every village and every <i>Wirthshaus</i> in
the forest, of any notoriety, promised music or dancing
on Sundays, sometimes both; and fortunate was the
one that could announce the military band. Double
<i>Lager</i> beer, a penny the pot, was offered in abundance
sufficient to satisfy the thirstiest. "Stewed meat and
fresh sausages next Friday," is the inducement held
out by one ambitious little alehouse: and an enterprising
refectioner declares, "In my garden it gives fine
weather." And, as the <i>Dresdner Anzeiger</i> shows, they
do similar things in the metropolis. A coffee-house
keeper, "up four steps," says: "My most honoured
sir, I permit myself the freedom to invite you to a cup
of coffee next Sunday afternoon at three o'clock."
Certain young men publish their sentiments concerning
their hostess, beginning with</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"Angels until now have led thee,"</p>
</div></div>

<p>and so on. A fortunate husband and father thanks
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
Madame Krändel for the "happy <i>Entbindung</i>" of his
wife, and publishes his wife's maiden name. Parents
announce the death of a child, and invite their friends
to "quiet sympathy." A stray Berlin paper makes it
clear that a like practice prevails in the capital of
Prussia. But most amusing of all was the advertisement,
in French and English, of the landlord of the
<i>Golden Star</i>, at Bonn. Here it is:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<div class="stanza">
<p class="o1">"De cet hôtel la renommée</p>
<p>Promet sans exagération</p>
<p>Que vous y trouverez</p>
<p>Le comble de la perfection.</p>
<p class="i2">Le luxe de la salle à manger</p>
<p class="i2">Surpassera même votre idée."</p>
</div>
<div class="stanza">
<p>"By all visitors of the Rhine</p>
<p>Known as one of the most fine</p>
<p>And best conducted models</p>
<p>Of all Continental hotels.</p>
<p class="i2">The dining-room allowed to be</p>
<p class="i2">A grand pattern of luxury."</p>
</div></div></div>

<p>Which does not say much for the bard of Bonn. Besides
these there was the <i>Illustrated Village Barber</i>, a
paper published at Leipzig, full of humorous cuts, over
which the rustics chuckled not a little.<a name="FNanchor_A" id="FNanchor_A" href="#Footnote_A" class="fnanchor">[A]</a></p>

<p>Wildenthal has no church; the people, therefore, are
dependent on Eybenstock, three miles distant, for sermons,
baptisms, marriages, and burials; but, in common
with other villages, it has a good schoolhouse.
Hearing the sound of voices as I passed, I went in, and
had a talk with the master, who was a model of politeness.
He had about a hundred scholars, of both sexes,
in a room well-lighted and ventilated, with a spelling-frame,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
and black music board, ruled for four parts, and
other appliances of education placed along the walls.
Threepence a week&mdash;two and a half <i>neugroschen</i>&mdash;is
the highest rate paid at country schools; but there are
two lower rates to suit folk of scanty means, and the
very poorest pay nothing. The children attend school
from the age of six up to fourteen, with no vacations
except a fortnight at each of the three rural
ingatherings&mdash;haymaking, harvest, and potato-digging. The
hours of attendance are from seven to ten in the forenoon,
one to four in the afternoon.</p>

<p>"Yes, they are pretty good children," said the
master, in reply to my inquiry; "I have not much
trouble to keep them in order; but, in case of need,
here is a little instrument (<i>kleines Instrument</i>) which
comes to my aid;" and he produced a small birch from
a secret place behind his desk.</p>

<p>A general nudging went through the school, and
quick, sly looks from one to the other, at sight of the
interwoven twigs. "Ha! ha!" cried the master, "you
see they recognise it. However, 'tis very seldom called
for."</p>

<p>Then, mounting his rostrum, he said: "Now, children,
tell me&mdash;which is the most famous country in the
world?"</p>

<p>"<i>Eng-land!</i>" from all the hundred voices.</p>

<p>"Is it a most highly renowned country?"</p>

<p>"<i>Ja&mdash;ja&mdash;ja!</i>"</p>

<p>"And how is the chief city named?"</p>

<p>"<i>Lundun</i>"&mdash;the <i>u</i> sounded as in full.</p>

<p>"And when Saxony wants factories, and steam-engines,
and spinning-machinery, and railways, who
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
is it sends them hither, or comes over and makes
them?"</p>

<p>"<i>Eng-land!</i>" again, and with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>"Good. Now, children, look at the <i>Herr</i> standing
here by my side&mdash;look at him, I say, for he comes from
that famous country&mdash;<i>Eng-land!</i>"</p>

<p>It was a trial to my courage to become thus unexpectedly
the object for all eyes, and feeling bound to
say something in return for the master's compliment, I
replied that, "If England did do so much for Saxony,
it was only paying back in another form the prowess
and vigour which the Saxons long time ago had carried
into England. Moreover, in Saxony all children could
read; but in England there were many boys and girls
who could not read."</p>

<p>"Is it possible!" exclaimed the master, holding up
his hands. "How can that be?"</p>

<p>"It is part of our liberty. Any one in England is
perfectly free to be ignorant if he likes it best."</p>

<p>"Remarkable!" answered the dominie; and he inquired
concerning the amount of salary paid to schoolmasters
in England. His own appeared very small in
comparison; but were it not that bread was unusually
dear, and firewood five dollars the <i>Klafter</i>&mdash;notwithstanding
the vast forests&mdash;he was quite content, and
could live in comfort.</p>

<p>Beyond Wildenthal, the ascent is almost continuous:
now the road traverses a clearing where the new undergrowth
hides the many scattered stumps; now a grassy
slope thickly bestrewn with wild flowers; now a great
breadth of forest, where boulders peer out between the
stems, and brooks flow noisily, and long bunches of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
hairy moss hang from the branches, and the new shoots
of the firs, tipped with amber and gold, glisten and glow
in the light of the morning sun.</p>

<p>Ever deeper into the hills; the solitude interrupted
now and then by a gang of charcoal-burners with their
wagons, or an aristocratic carriage, or an humble chaise,
speeding on its way from Carlsbad. Or the sound of the
axe echoes through the wood, followed by the crash of
a falling tree. And always the wind murmurs among
the trees, swelling at times to a fitful roar.</p>

<p>I saw a stone-breaker at work, afflicted with a huge
goitre. He earns a dollar and a half per week, and
complains sadly of the dearness of bread, and the hardness
of the blue granite.</p>

<p>Gradually the tall forest gives place to scrubby-looking
firs, stony patches, rough with hardy heath, offering
a wild and dreary prospect. Presently a square stone,
standing by the road, exhibits on one side <i>K. Sachsen</i>
(Kingdom of Saxony), on the other <i>K. B&oelig;hmen</i>, and
passing this you are in Bohemia. Near it is the guard-house,
where two soldiers are always on the watch. One
of them asked me if my knapsack contained anything for
duty, accepted my negative without demur, and invited
me to sit down and have a chat on the turfy seat by the
side of the door. It was a pleasure to see a new face,
for their life was very monotonous, looking out, from
noon of one day to noon of the next, for honest folk and
smugglers, suffering none to pass unquestioned. They
were not much troubled with contrabandists, for these
free-traders shun the highway, and cross the frontier by
secret paths in lonely parts of the mountains.</p>

<p>The summit here forms a table-land some three thousand
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
feet above the sea-level, with a prospect by no means
cheering; limited by the stunted firs, except towards the
south-west, where a few black, dreary-looking undulations
terminate the view. The road, however, soon
begins to descend to a less inhospitable region, and presently
makes a sudden dip, for the slope of the <i>Erzgebirge</i>,
long and gradual towards Saxony, is abrupt on the
Bohemian side. The other mountain ranges present a
similar formation. Then we come to tall trees, and
grassy glades, stony clearings, and acres of bilberries. A
little farther, and the sight of a crucifix, bearing a gilt
Christ, by the wayside, and of miserable wooden cottages,
roofed with shingles, convinces you that the frontier
is really crossed. A valley opens where haymakers
are busy; the men wearing the straight tight boots, the
women barefoot, and with a kerchief pinned hood-fashion
under the chin. "<i>Gelobt sei Jesus Christus</i>"&mdash;Praised be
Jesus Christ&mdash;salute the children as you pass, and some
of them stand still with an expectant look. Then posts,
and a toll-bar, painted in the diagonal stripes of black and
yellow, which symbolise imperial Austria. The bar is
kept down, but sufficiently high above the ground for
a man to walk under it without ducking. Having
passed this you are in Hirschenstand&mdash;the first Bohemian
village.</p>

<p>"Perhaps you come out of Saxony?" said a man,
stepping from a house that had a double eagle above the
door, and holding out his hand for my passport.</p>

<p>He was very civil, and also very positive in his assurance
that he could not grant me a <i>visa</i> for Prague; only
for Carlsbad, and he wished me a pleasant journey. A
few yards farther I turned into the inn to dine, and at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">57</a></span>
once met with characteristic specimens of the two races
who inhabit Bohemia. There was the German, with a
round, flat, hairy face, stolid in expression, and somewhat
sluggish in movement, and by his side the Czech, or
Stock-Bohemian, whose oval countenance, high intellectual
forehead, arched eyebrows, clear olive complexion,
unrelieved by moustache or whisker, presented a marked
contrast; the Sclavonian, bright-eyed and animated;
the Teuton, dull and heavy. Yet the latter is gaining
upon his lively neighbour. The German population is
every year increasing, and the Czechish language is
spoken within a narrower circle. The contrast between
the two races will be something for observation during
our walk, and with another noticeable difference when
we approach the frontier of Silesia.</p>

<p>There was something peculiar in the room as well as
in the guests; at one side a tall clock, and very tall
candlesticks; in the middle a chopping-block, bearing a
heap of sausage-meat; a washing-tub and copper-pans in
one corner, and on the opposite side a species of bagatelle-board,
on which the ball is expected to find its way into
the holes between long palisades of little wires: an
exciting game; for even the slow German was quickened
as he watched the constant repulsions of the little globe
hovering round the highest number only to fail of entering.</p>

<p>Here, too, were the tall wooden chairs which are
seldom seen beyond the Austrian frontier. It made me
smile to renew acquaintance with the lanky, spider-legged
things. Not the most comfortable contrivance for dispelling
weariness, as you would perhaps think, reader,
were you to see one. They are, however, very cheap;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
not more than thirty-five kreutzers apiece, made of
pine, and a florin when of hard wood. Both curiosities
in their way.</p>

<p>Hirschenstand will hardly prepossess you in favour of
Bohemian villages, for its houses are shabby boarded
structures, put up with a wonderful disregard of order
and neatness&mdash;windows all awry, the chimney anyhow,
and the fit of the door a scandal to carpentry. And
the cottages scattered about the valley, and for some
distance along the road, preserve the family likeness
strongly marked. They would have a touch of the
picturesque with far projecting eaves, but the roofs are
not made to overhang. You might easily fancy that
the land had not yet recovered from the effects of the
exterminating Hussite wars, out of which arose the
proverb, "Scarce as Bohemian villages."</p>

<p>But Carlsbad is nearly seven hours distant, and we
must hasten onwards. The road still descends: the
prospect opens over forests far broader than on the
Saxon side: valleys branch off, and the scenery improves.
Rocks choke the brooks, and burst out from
the slopes; rows of ash, lime, and cherry-trees, bordering
the road, succeed to the firs, and large whitewashed
houses with tall roofs to the shabby cottages. Then
iron works; and little needle factories driven by a mere
spoutful of water rattling and buzzing merrily as grasshoppers.</p>

<p>Then Neudeck, where a high rock overtops the
houses, and projects into the street, having the appearance,
when first seen, of an ancient tower. We
shall see similar strange-looking rocks, from time to
time, on the hill-side, as if to prepare us for rocky
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
scenes of wonderful character in a subsequent part of
our travel. A high steep hill close to the town is
cut up with zigzags, by which the devout may ascend
from station to station to the Calvary on the top, from
whence the view, at all events, will repay the trouble.
The road was made, and the stations and chapel were
built, at the cost of an ancient maiden lady, who a few
years ago expended 27,000 dollars in the purchase of
the hill for the good of her soul.</p>

<p>Now the road descends through a vale between broad
fields of wheat and potatoes, to the smoky porcelain
manufacturing town of Alt, where your eye will, perhaps,
be attracted by a few pretty faces among the
women, set off by a pink, blue, or green jacket, and
petticoat of a different colour. But for the most part the
women have a dowdy appearance, of which the Czechs,
as we shall by-and-by see, exhibit the dowdiest examples.</p>

<p>Still the road descends towards the black group of
hills which encircle Carlsbad. It was nearly dark when
I crossed the bridge and entered the celebrated watering-place.
At first I thought every house an inn, for
every front carries a sign&mdash;somewhat puzzling to a belated
stranger. At length the <i>Gasthof zum Morgenstern</i>
opened its door to receive me; much to my comfort,
for I was very tired, having walked altogether thirty
miles. Great was my enjoyment of rest. At supper
the landlord brought the beer in a large boot-shaped
glass, and placed it before me with the chuckling remark
that he liked his guests to be able to say they had
one time in their lives drunk out of a boot.</p>

<p>His wife, who appeared to be as good-humoured as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
she was good-looking, amused me with her gossip.
Her especial delight was to laugh at the peculiarities of
her guests, and their mistakes in speaking German.
One, a bilious Greek, had come down one morning with
his hand to his head complaining of <i>Fuss-schmerz</i>&mdash;foot-ache.
The Saxons, she said, could not cook, or make
good butter, and were ready to drink a quart of any
kind of brown fluid, and believe it to be coffee.

Florins for a Bed.
</p>

<p class="p2">"To lie abed till you are done enough," says Dr.
Fowler, of Salisbury, "is the way to promote health
and long life;" and he justifies his assertion by living
to the age of ninety, with promise of adding yet somewhat
to the number. Remembering this, I let duty
and inclination have their way the next morning, and
the market-women in front of the inn had nearly sold
off their baskets of flowers and vegetables before I set
out to explore the wonders of Carlsbad.</p>

<p>"It's a Matlocky sort of a place!" cried a young
lady, as I passed an elegant party, who were sauntering
about the pleasant grounds behind the <i>Theresienbrunn</i>&mdash;"it's
a Matlocky sort of a place!" And a merry
laugh followed the iteration of her ingenious adjective.
That it is not altogether inappropriate is apparent as
soon as you arrive on the upper terrace and overlook a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
small town, lying deep between hills on either side of
the Teple, a shallow and sharply-curved stream.</p>

<p>All the springs but two are on the left bank, a few
yards from the water's edge. There is a little architectural
display in the buildings by which they are
covered: a domed roof, supported on columns, or a
square, temple-like structure, flanked by colonnades.
The water flows into a cavity, more or less deeply sunk
below the surface, surrounded by stone steps, on which
sit the nimble lasses, priestesses of health, who every
morning from six to ten are busily employed in dispensing
the exhaustless medicine. A few vase-like
cups stand ready for use; but numbers of the visitors
bring their own glass, carried as a bouquet in the hand,
of tasteful Bohemian manufacture, striped with purple
or ruby, and some of the purest white. All are made
of the same size&mdash;to contain six ounces&mdash;and a few
have a species of dial attached, by which to keep count
of the number of doses swallowed. The visitors, having
their glasses filled at the fountain, walk up or down
the colonnade, or along the paths of the pleasure-ground,
listening to music, or form little groups for a
morning gossip, and sip and chat alternately till the
glasses are emptied. The rule is to wait a quarter-hour
between each refilling, so that a patient condemned
to a dozen glasses dissipates three hours in the watery
task. The number imbibed depends on the complaint
and constitution: in some instances four glasses are
taken; in others, from twenty to forty.</p>

<p>I tasted each spring as I came to it, and felt no inclination
to repeat the experiment. The temperature of
the <i>Theresienbrunn</i> is 134 deg., of the <i>Mühlbrunn</i> 138
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
deg., of the <i>Neubrunn</i> 144 deg., in itself a cause of dislike,
especially in hot weather, and much more so when
combined with a disagreeable bitter, and a flavour which
I can only compare to a faint impression of the odour
of a dissecting-room. No wonder some of the drinkers
shudder as they swallow their volcanic physic! But
more about the waters after we have seen the <i>Sprudel</i>.</p>

<p>In some places the cliff comes so near to the stream
that there is no more than room for a colonnade, or
narrow road, and here and there the path, stopped
by a projecting rock, is carried round the rear of
the obstacle by little intricate zigzags. And every
minute you come to some ramifications of the narrow
lanes, which here, so limited and valuable is the space,
serve the purpose of streets, and afford ready access to
the heights above. The houses rise tier over tier, in
short rows, or perched singly on curious platforms excavated
from the rock, in situations where back windows
would be useless. The topmost dwellers have
thus an opportunity to amuse their idleness by a bird's-eye
view of what their neighbours are doing below.
From May to September the influx of visitors is so
great that every house is full of inmates.</p>

<p>As every house has its sign or designation, ingenuity
has been not a little taxed to avoid repetitions. One
ambitious proprietor writes up <i>At the King of England</i>;
another, contenting himself with his native tongue, has
<i>König von England</i>; a third, <i>English House</i>. A little
farther, and you see <i>Captain Cook</i>; <i>The Comet</i>; <i>The
Aurora</i>; and many varieties of Rings, Spoons, and
Musical Instruments. <i>Israelitisch Restauration</i> notifies
the tribes of a dining-room; here <i>The Admiral</i>, there
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
<i>The Corporal</i>, yonder <i>The Pasha</i> claims attention; and in
a steep street leading towards Prague I saw <i>The A B C</i>.
And here and there a doll in a glass-case fixed to the
wall, representing St. Anne&mdash;a favourite saint of the
Bohemians&mdash;looks down on the sauntering visitors.</p>

<p>Continuing up the left bank you enter the market-place,
where the indications of life and business multiply,
and a throng are sipping around the <i>Marktbrunn</i>. This
spring burst up from under the paving-stones in 1838;
a temple was built over it, and ever since it has served
as a temple of ease to some of the more crowded springs.
A little farther, and you come to the <i>Wiese</i>, or meadow,
which retains no more of grass than Hatton-garden
does of gravelled paths and flower-beds: a row of
houses and shops on one side, on the other a line of
wooden booths concealing the river, and all between
planted with trees which shelter an irregular regiment
of chairs and tables. Here is the place where visitors
most do congregate, pacing leisurely to and fro, or
lounging on the chairs in front of the cafés, gossiping
over the newspapers, or trifling around the stalls and
shop windows.</p>

<p>A remarkable throng, truly! Some with an air
highly dignified and aristocratic; but the greater part
somewhat grotesque in appearance. Graceful ladies
with those ungraceful sprawling bonnets not uncommon
in Germany; men, lanky and angular, and short and
round, and square and awkward, wearing astonishing
wide-awakes. Such a variety of loose, baggy trousers,
magnificent waistcoats, and gauzy gowns, that look
impalpable almost as a cloud! Here comes a Polish
Jew with manifest signs of having remained unclean
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
beyond more than one evening; here a Czechish
count, who has not forgotten his military paces; here a
spectacled professor, with boots turned up peak-wise,
and toes turned broadly out; here a group of Hebrews
glittering with jewelry; and here a miscellaneous
crowd from all the countries of Europe, but Germans
the most numerous. Of English very few. There
is nothing stiff or formal about them; to make things
pleasant seems to be a tacit understanding, for disease
has brought them all to one common level. All are
animated by the hope of cure, and find therein an inspiration
towards gaiety.</p>

<p>But who shall be gay in an hospital, among sallow,
haggard faces, sunken eyes, and ghastly features? Some
you see who, preyed upon by disease for years, have well-nigh
lost all faith in the smiler who lingers so long at the
bottom of the box; some afflicted by hypochondriasis
appear to wonder that the sun should shine, that others
can be happy while they themselves are so miserable.
The lively fiddles, and twanging harps, and jingling
tambourines&mdash;the Tyrolese minstrels&mdash;the glib conjuror,
all fail to bring a flash of joy back to their deadened
eye; to win for mirth one responsive thrill. I have
never been more thankfully sensible of the blessing of
robust health, than while strolling on the <i>Wiese</i> at
Carlsbad.</p>

<p>What with its many stalls and shops, the <i>Wiese</i> resembles
a bazaar. All sorts of trifles and knick-knacks
tempt the visitor, and entice money from the purse.
Among queer-looking toys you see <span class="smcap">Windsor Soap</span>
labelled in good, honest English; pipes, ribands, and
pocket-books, fans, satchels, and jewelry, among specimens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
of <i>Sprudelstein</i>, and crystals and minerals, from
the surrounding hills. Money-changers abound; and
polyglot placards&mdash;English, French, German, Czechish,
Hungarian&mdash;everywhere meet the eye. And not only
here, but all over the town, brisk signs of business and
prosperity are apparent. But to quote the gossip of my
hostess, "many in Carlsbad have to endure hunger
during the winter." The place is then deserted, for the
season lasts only from May to September.</p>

<p>Turn into a short <i>Gasse</i> from the market-place, cross
the foot-bridge, and you will see a Geyser without the
fatigue of a voyage to Iceland. It is the far-famed
<i>Sprudel</i>, or Bubbler. At one end of a colonnade open
to the river on the right bank, a living column of water
springs perpetually from the ground. Through an
orifice in the centre of a basin about three feet deep, the
water leaps and plays with a noise of gurgling, splashing,
and bubbling, to a height of six or eight feet, and
throwing off clouds of steam. Now it forms a column
with palm-leafed capital&mdash;now a number of jets tumbling
over in graceful curves&mdash;now broken, fan-like
masses, all throbbing and dancing in obedience to the
vigorous pulsations under ground. There is something
fascinating in the sight. Allowing for the artificial
elevation of the floor, the whole height of the jet is
about twelve feet; and so has it leaped for ages, and
with but one interruption since its fabulous discovery
in the fourteenth century.</p>

<p>The <i>Sprudel</i> is the hottest of the springs, scalding
hot, in fact, marking a temperature of 167 deg. Fahrenheit:
hence the attendant Naiads&mdash;here a couple of
strong-armed women&mdash;make use of a cup fixed to one
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
end of a staff for filling the glasses. When a visitor
approaches, the staff is held out to receive the glass;
and after a plunge into the steaming jet, is handed back
to the expectant drinker, who, taking his glass from the
cup, swallows the contents at pleasure&mdash;if he can.
The drinkers were but few when I came up, for ten
o'clock was nigh; stragglers, who having arrived late,
were sipping their last glasses&mdash;some not without a
shudder. While the dose cooled, they examined the
heads of walking-sticks, snuff-boxes, seals, and other
specimens of <i>Sprudelstein</i>, on sale at a stall; or the time-tables
and advertisement photographs hanging about
the colonnade. The Naiads, in the interval, emptied
ladles full of the water into stone-bottles, which a man
rapidly corked in a noisy machine.</p>

<p>The waste water flows away along a wooden shoot to
the river, where it sends small light wreaths of steam
floating about on the surface. But I saw nothing at all
like what has been often described as a cloud of steam
perpetually hovering above the <i>Sprudel</i>, visible from
afar. Regarded near at hand, or from a distance, there
is no cloud visible in July, whatever may be the case in
the cool months.</p>

<p>The quantity of water poured out every day by the
<i>Sprudel</i> alone is estimated at two million gallons. Multiplied
by 365, it becomes truly amazing. In this
quantity, as shown by Gilbert, a German chemist, ten
thousand tons of Glauber salt, and fifteen thousand tons
of carbonate of soda are thrown up in a year. And this
has been going on from immemorial ages, the waters depositing
calcareous matter in their outflow, which has
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
slowly formed a crust over the vast boiling reservoir beneath.
And on this crust Carlsbad is built.</p>

<p>The constituents of all the springs, as proved by
analyses, are identical with those of the <i>Sprudel</i>&mdash;soda
in the form of carbonate, Glauber salt, and common salt;
carbonic acid gas, and traces of iron and iodine. Bitumen
is also found in a notable quantity, and a peculiar
soapy substance, a species of animal matter, the cause,
perhaps, of the cadaverous flavour already mentioned.
The water, which when first caught is bright and clear,
becomes turbid if left to cool, and throws down a pale-brown
sediment. Ehrenberg, the celebrated microscopist
of Berlin, who has examined specimens of this
sediment under his microscope, declares it to be composed
of fossil animalcules inconceivably minute; these
animalcules being a portion of the material out of which
Nature builds up the solid strata of the globe. Some
patients have feared to drink the water because of the
concreting property; but the medical authorities assure
that in this respect it produces no injurious effect on the
animal economy. Shopkeepers turn it to profit, and
offer you fruits, flowers, plants, and other objects, petrified
by the <i>Sprudel</i> water.</p>

<p>The roof of the colonnade above the spring is discoloured
by the ascending steam; and standing on
the bridge you can see how the wall is incrusted with
calcareous matter, as, also, the big hump swelling up
from the bed of the stream&mdash;a smooth ochreous coat,
brightened in places by amber, in others darkened into
a rich brown, or dyed with shades of green. This concretion
is the <i>Sprudelstein</i>, or Sprudel-stone, noticed
above; firm and hard in texture, and susceptible of a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
beautiful polish. A portion of the waste water is led
into an adjoining building, where it undergoes evaporation
to obtain the constituent salts in a dry state for
exportation. From the other shoot, as it falls into the
river, supplies are constantly dipped by the townsfolk,
who use it to cook their eggs, to scald pork and poultry,
and other purposes. All day long you may see women
filling and carrying away on their shoulders big bucketfuls
of the steaming water. Notwithstanding this constant
inflow of hot water, the Teple appears to agree
with fish, for I saw numbers swimming about in good
condition but a short distance lower down. As a stream,
it adds little to the salubrity of Carlsbad, for it is shallow,
sluggish in places, and tainted by noisome drainage.
Another cause of offence to the nostrils exists in what is
so often complained of on the Continent, the obtrusive
situation of the <i>latrinæ</i> at the principal springs. Only
in England are such matters properly cared for.</p>

<p>In 1809, and for ten years thereafter, the <i>Sprudel</i>
ceased to flow, and the water broke through at a spot
some fifty feet distant, to which the name <i>Hygieas
Quelle</i> was given. Here it continued to play till 1819,
when it reappeared at the former source, and from that
date there has been no interruption in the copious discharge
of the <i>Sprudel</i>. The underground action is at
times so powerful as to rend the crust and form new
openings, and these, if large, have to be stopped, to prevent
the loss of the springs. The yellow hump mentioned
as swelling up from the river's bed, is nothing
but a thick mass of masonry, braced together by iron
bars, covering a great rent through which the waters
once boiled up from below. Similar outbreaks occurred
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
in 1713, and again fourteen years later, when attempts
were made to ascertain the depth of the great subterranean
reservoir by splicing poles together to a length of
one hundred and eighty feet, but neither bottom nor
wall could be touched in any direction. The hills
around are of granite, containing mica and pyrites, and
one of them, the <i>Hirschsprung</i>, is said to be the source
of all the Carlsbad springs. Their bases come near together,
and it is easy to imagine a huge cavern formed
between them descending deep down into the bowels of
the earth.</p>

<p>As regards the efficacy of the Carlsbad waters, let us
hear Dr. Granville, an authority on the subject: "They
exert their principal sanative action," he says, "1st, on
all chronic affections which depend on debility of the
digestive organs, accompanied by the accumulation of
improper secretions; 2ndly, on all obstructions, particularly
of the abdomen, which, as Becher, the oracle of
Carlsbad, observes, they resolve and disperse; 3rdly, on
the acrimony of the blood, which they correct, alter,
evacuate, or drive towards the extremities and the surface
of the body; 4thly, on calculous and gravelly deposits;
5thly, on many occult and serious disorders, the nature
of which is not readily ascertained until after the partial
use of the waters, such as tic doloreux, spasms, rheumatisms,
and gout."</p>

<p>As if here were not virtues sufficient, the Doctor proceeds:
"My own experience warrants me in commending
the Carlsbad waters in all obstinate cases of induration,
tumefaction, tenderness, and sluggish action of the
liver; in imperfect or suppressed gout; in paralysis, dependent
on the stomach, and not fulness of blood in the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
head; in cases of tic and nervous disorders; finally, in
obstructions of the glands of the mesentery, and distended
state of the splenetic vessels." The effect on
stones in the bladder is almost magical, so promptly are
they polished, reduced, rendered friable, and expelled,
leaving the patient a happy example of perfect cure.</p>

<p>"It is the despondent," to quote once more from the
Doctor, "the dejected, misanthropic, fidgetty, pusillanimous,
irritable, outrageous, morose, sulky, weak-minded,
whimsical, and often despairing hypochondriac&mdash;for he
is all these, and each in turn&mdash;made so by continued indigestion,
by obstinate and unremitting gout, by affections
of the nerves of sympathy and of the gastric region,
and by other equally active causes, that Carlsbad seems
pre-eminently to favour." After reading this, the wonder
is, not that the visitors number from five to six
thousand in the course of the season, but that they are
not ten times as many.</p>

<p>The Doctor finds nothing nauseous in the taste of the
water. "Once arrived in the stomach," he says, "it
produces an exhilarating sensation, which spreads itself
to the intestinal canal generally." To him I leave the
responsibility of this statement; for, preferring to let
well alone, I sipped by spoonfuls only, and can therefore
bring no testimony from my own experience. The
practice of drinking the waters has almost set aside the
once exclusive practice of bathing; but baths are always
to be had, as well of mud and vapour as of the water of
the springs.</p>

<p>Now, after this stroll through the town, let us take a
wider survey. As we follow the street down the right
bank, we see parties setting off in carriages for excursions
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
to the neighbourhood, and rows of vehicles in the
open places ticketed, <i>Return to Marienbad</i>, <i>to Eger</i>, <i>to
Töplitz</i>, <i>to Zwickau</i>, and the like, and drivers on the
alert for what your London cab-driver calls "a job." A
short distance beyond the <i>Morgenstern</i> a path zigzags
gradually up the hill and brings you soon under the shade
of trees, and to many little nooks and sheltered seats
contrived for delightful repose. One remote bower, apparently
but little frequented, is inscribed, <i>Care's Rest:
make thyself happy</i>. A little farther, and crossing a
carriage-road, we come to a temple where you may
have another rest, and enjoy at the same time the opening
panorama. From hence the paths zigzag onwards
to the top of the <i>Dreikreuzberg</i>&mdash;Three-Cross Hill&mdash;by
easy shady slopes, which even a short-winded patient
may ascend, while those with strong legs may shorten
the distance by the steep cut-offs. An agreeable surprise
awaits you at the top: a large, well-kept garden, gay and
fragrant with flowers, surrounded by arbours of clipped
fir, and a graceful screen of trees, while at one side
stands a spacious <i>Restauration</i>&mdash;all clean and cheerful of
aspect. From an elevated platform, or from the arched
recesses on the terrace in front of the garden, you see
all Carlsbad and the hilly region around.</p>

<p>Now you see how singularly crooked is the narrow
valley in which the town is built; how the white houses
gleam from the steep green sides of the farther hills,
and straggle away to the wooded hollow at the head of
the valley, from whence the river issues in a shining
curve. In and out flows the stream past the church,
past the springs and public buildings, cutting the town
in two, on its way to fall into the Eger. Your eye
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
takes in the life of the streets, the goings to and fro,
but on a reduced scale&mdash;such tiny men and women,
and little carriages! 'Tis as if one were looking into
Lilliput. Opposite rises the precipitous rocky hill, the
Hirschsprung, to the craggy summit of which we shall
climb by-and-by; and beyond it, ridgy summits, away
to the gloomy expanse of the <i>Schlaggenwald</i>. Many are
the paths that penetrate the rearward valleys, and white
roads curving along the hill-sides high above Carlsbad,
and far up the distant slopes. Altogether the view
is striking, and somewhat romantic; yet in the eyes of
the Germans fresh from their flat, uninteresting country,
it is "<i>wunderschön</i>"&mdash;an epithet which they never
tire of heaping on the landscape.</p>

<p>From the garden a path leads along the ridge to a
higher elevation, where the three tall crosses, seen for
miles around, spring from a rocky knoll at the rear of a
small semicircular opening, enclosed by firs, prettily intermingled
with beech and birch. Heath and yellow
broom grow from crevices in the rocks, and the wild
thyme, crushed by your foot, fills the air with aromatic
sweetness, for the spot is left to the nurture of the
winds and the rain. It commands the same view as
from the garden; but with a wider scope, and the town
lying at a greater depth.</p>

<p>The path still curving along the ridge brings you
presently to <i>König Otto's Höhe</i>&mdash;King Otto's Height&mdash;the
highest point of the hill. This is also an untrimmed
spot, with two or three seats, and a fluted
granite column, surmounted by a globe and star, rising
in the midst. You now look over some of the nearer
hills, and get fresh peeps into the valleys, discovering
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
topographical secrets. Raised high into the region of
cooling breezes, yet easily accessible, it is a pleasant
place for quiet recreation.</p>

<p>I took the shortest way down from Otto's Height,
crossing the rough declivity and the fields that stretch
far up the lower slope of the hill, and made a circuit to
Findlater's monument at the upper extremity of Carlsbad.
From the eminence on which it is erected you
get a new prospect of the town, and up the valley of
umbrageous retreats much resorted to by visitors on
sultry afternoons.</p>

<p>On my way back to the <i>Morgenstern</i> I had another
look at the <i>Sprudel</i>. The place was now deserted; the
Naiads had departed; the stall-keeper had locked her
glazed doors and withdrawn; and there was nothing
near to subdue the vivid rushing sound of the water.
So to remain till evening, when a few anxious patients
would appear to quaff new draughts of health.</p>

<p>The inn was in all the bustle of dinner, after the
manner of a <i>table d'hôte</i>, but without its formality&mdash;twenty
little tables instead of a single large one. By
this arrangement the guests formed small parties, and
ate and chatted at pleasure. Many came in who were
not lodgers in the house&mdash;among them a countess, from
Moravia, to whom no more attention was paid, nor did
she appear to expect it, than to the others. The absence
of stiffness was, indeed, an agreeable characteristic of
the company, who were mostly Germans.</p>

<p>"Are you here for the cure?" said an old gentleman
who sat opposite me, and looked at my tankard of beer
and salad with an air of surprise. "Are you not
afraid?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span></p>

<p>My answer reassured him. Visitors who come to
drink the waters are required by medical authority to
conform to a simple regimen. To eat no salad, fruit,
or vegetables&mdash;to drink no beer or wine&mdash;to eat no
bread. The exceptional cases are rare; hence the provision
consists but of sundry preparations of meat, decanters
of water, pudding resembling boiled pound-cake,
and baskets of small rolls. The latter, made of
wheaten flour, are not recognised as bread, but come
under the common term, <i>Semmel</i>&mdash;the simmel of which
we read in descriptions of lordly banquets in our Plantagenet
days. The term bread is confined to the large
brown and black loaves made of rye meal, the staple
of household diet in Bohemia; and to Carlsbad patients
this is forbidden. So Nature always goes on vindicating
her simple laws, convincing mankind, in spite
of themselves, of the wholesome effects of fresh air,
daily exercise, plain food, and spring water; and mankind,
returned to crowded cities and artificial pleasures,
go on forgetting a lesson which is as old as the
hills.</p>

<p>In the afternoon I mounted to the top of the <i>Hirschsprung</i>,
and passed two or three hours on the jutting
crags which overlook the town and a wide expanse of
rolling fields and meadows towards Saxony. Stairs and
fenced platforms on the outermost points enable you to
survey in full security. The conformation of the crags
is not unlike that which prevails in the Saxon Switzerland.
Here and there tablets in the rock record the
visits of royal personages, and on the topmost, surmounted
by a cross, is an inscription in Russian, and
the name of Czar Peter, who included among his exploits
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
that of riding up the <i>Hirschsprung</i> on horseback
in 1711.</p>

<p>You cannot be long in Carlsbad without hearing a
flourish of trumpets from the top of the Watch-tower,
announcing the arrival of visitors. No sooner do the
trumpeters spy a carriage approaching from their lofty
station, than they begin to sound, and, in proportion to
the appearance of the vehicle, so do they measure out
their blast&mdash;most wind for the proudest. While I was
looking down, a sudden note, unusually prolonged,
woke up the drowsy echoes, for rattling down the zigzagged
highway from Prague came his unenviable
majesty, Otho of Greece, to undergo a course of the
<i>Sprudel</i>&mdash;at least, so said the newspapers. Not till he
had alighted at the hotel did the trumpeters cease their
salute, for kings can pay well; but let a dusty-footed
wayfarer, with knapsack on shoulder, come into the
town, and not a breath will they spare to give him welcome.</p>

<p>At six in the evening&mdash;having surveyed Carlsbad
from within and without, and from the highest points
on either side&mdash;I started to walk to Buchau, a village
about ten miles off&mdash;an easy distance before nightfall.
The <i>Morgenstern</i> charged me two florins for my bed,
and less than two florins for all my diet&mdash;supper, breakfast,
and dinner; which, in one of the dearest watering-places
in Europe, was letting me off on reasonable
terms.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII.</h2>

<p class="hanging">
Departure from Carlsbad&mdash;Dreifaltigkeits-Kirche&mdash;Engelhaus&mdash;The
Castle&mdash;A Melancholy Village&mdash;Up to the Ruins&mdash;An Imperial Visit&mdash;Bohemian
Scenery&mdash;On to Buchau&mdash;The Inn&mdash;A Crowd of Guests&mdash;Roast

to Bed.
</p>

<p class="p2">Some years ago Carlsbad was scarcely accessible by
vehicles coming from the interior, so abrupt was the
declivity of its western hill. Now the difficulty is overcome
by the zigzags of an excellent road, such as
Austrian engineers know well how to construct. The
shortest way out of the town for one on foot is up a
street painfully steep, which brings you at once to an
elevation, whence there is a view of the hills and hollows
at the head of the valley. The zigzags are long,
and there are no cut-offs, whereby you lose sight but
slowly of the Valley of Springs.</p>

<p>Once past the brow and a view opens over a hilly
landscape in the opposite direction, repeating the characteristics
of Bohemian scenery&mdash;large unfenced fields,
with clumps of firs and patches of forest on the highest
swells, and the road, in long undulations, running between
rows of birch and mountain-ash. There is a monotony
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
about it, varied only by the difference of crops,
the rise and fall of the ground, or rags of mist which,
after a shower, hang about the dark sides of distant hills.
By-and-by the ruined castle of Engelhaus, crowning a
conical hill, peers up on the left, higher and higher as
you advance, till at length it stands out a huge mass,
looking grimly down on a village beneath.</p>

<p>But now a low building on the right attracts your
attention. It is a small, low, triangular church&mdash;<i>Dreifaltigkeits-Kirche</i>&mdash;in
a narrow graveyard, where
the few mounds and the low wooden crosses that mark
them are scarcely to be seen for tall grass and weeds.
The interior, so far as I could see through a chink in
the rusty, unpainted door, contains nothing remarkable
except a rude altar, and a small gallery in each angle.
A chapel and arcades are built against two sides of the
enclosing wall, and four life-size figures of apostolic
aspect sit, recline, and kneel in front of a half-length
figure, bearing a crucifix, placed in a recess. They
seemed fit guardians of a place which wears an appearance
of neglect.</p>

<p>A little farther and there is a byeway, leading across
the fields to Engelhaus, about a quarter-mile distant,
and a very Irish-looking village it is; squalid and filthy,
built in what, to a stranger, appears a total disregard of
the fitness of things. Here and there the noise of a
loom&mdash;a noise which denotes a poverty-stricken existence&mdash;sounded
from some of the cottages, and the aspect
of the villagers is quite in keeping with their environment.
And yet a wandering musician, who carried a
trestle to rest his organ on, was trying to coax a few
<i>Kreutzers</i> out of their pockets by airs most unmelodious;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
as if the worst kind of music were good enough for folk
so deficient in a sense of propriety. The inside of the
houses is no better than the outside. Seeing a pale,
damp-browed weaver at a window, I stopped to put a
question. He opened the casement, and out rushed a
stream of air so hot, stifling, and malodorous as fully accounted
for his abject looks, and made me content with
the briefest answer.</p>

<p>A steep path, completed in one place by a wooden
stair, leads you up and along the precipitous side of the
hill to the principal entrance of the castle, an old weatherbeaten
arch bestriding the whole of the narrow way.
Here a few tall trees form the commencement of an
avenue, which the young trees planted farther on will
one day complete, and increase the charm of the ancient
remains. The path skirting the bold crags passes an old
tower, and enters a court which, since the visit of the
Emperor and Empress in 1854, is called the <i>Kaiserplatz</i>.
Three young trees, supported by stakes painted black
and yellow, and blue and white, are growing up into
memorials of the incident, and dwarf-firs, set in the
turfy slope, form the initials F i E&mdash;<i>Francis Joseph,
Elizabeth</i>. A small pool in one corner reflects the
dilapidated walls; the mountain-ash, trailing grasses,
and harebells grow from the crevices, trembling in the
breeze; and the place, cool, green, and sequestered, is
one where you would like to sit musing on a summer
afternoon.</p>

<p>The steep and uneven ground adds much to the picturesque
effect of the ruin. You make your way from
court to court by sudden abrupt ascents and descents,
protected in places by a fence&mdash;now under a broken
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">80</a></span>
arch, now creeping into a vault, now traversing a roofless
hall, climbing the fragment of a stair, or pacing
round the base of the mighty keep. Loose stones lie
about, bits of walls peer through the soil, or, concealed
beneath, form grassy hummocks, showing how great
have been the ravages of time and other foes. Here and
there stands a portion of wall on the very brink of the
precipice, and a railing stretched from one to the other
enables you to contemplate the prospect in safety. The
appearance of the country is such that the hill appears
to be in the centre of a great, slightly-hollowed basin,
which has a dark and distant rim. The basin is everywhere
heaving with undulations, patched and striped
with firs and the lines of trees along the highways, while
a few ponds gleam in some of the deepest hollows. A
few widely scattered cottages, or the white walls of a
farmstead, dot the green surface of the fields; and such
is the general character of the scenery all the way from
the <i>Erzgebirge</i> to Prague&mdash;indeed, all the central region
of Bohemia. One league, with small differences, is but
a repetition of the other.</p>

<p>I prowled so long about the ruins, enjoying the lusty
breeze that shook the branches merrily and roared
through the crevices, that long shadows crept over the
landscape, raising the highest points into bold relief, and
veiling the remoter scenes before I descended. The sun,
fallen below the Saxon mountains, lit up an immense
crescent of angry clouds with a lurid glare, from which
the twilight caught a touch of awfulness. The ponds
shone with unearthly lustre for a few moments, and then
lay cold and gray, and there seemed something spectral
in the thin lines of firs as they rose against the glare.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span></p>

<p>I returned to the road, and found the last two or
three miles solitary enough, for not a soul did I meet,
and the way lay through a forest where the only light
was a faint streak overhead. It was near ten o'clock
when I came to Buchau&mdash;a village of low houses built
round a great square&mdash;in which stood some twenty or
thirty laden wagons. The appearance of things at <i>The
Sun</i> was not encouraging: a dozen wagoners in blue
gaberdines lay stretched on straw in the sitting-room,
leaving but a small corner of the floor vacant, where sat
the host, who made many apologies for having to turn
me away. I walked across the square, and tried <i>Der
Herrnhaus</i>, and on opening the door met with a rare
surprise. The large room was crowded with some threescore
guests, including a few soldiers, seated at narrow
tables along the sides and across the middle, every man
with his tankard of beer before him. In one corner a party
of gipsies played wild and lively music, making the room
echo again with the sounds of flageolet, violin, and bass,
and electrifying the company with their wizard harmonies.
Some, unable to contain themselves, chanted a
few bars of the inspiriting measure; others beat time
with hands or feet, and joined in a whoop at the emphatic
passages; and all the while a gruff outpouring of
talk struggled with the bass for the mastery. There was
a clatter of knives and forks, a rattling of pewter-lids by
impatient tipplers, and hasty cries for pieces of bread.
And over all hung a cloud of smoke, rolling broader and
deeper as the puffs and swirls went up from fifty pipes.</p>

<p>This scene bursting upon me all at once made me
stand for a minute in doubtful astonishment, half dazzled
by the sudden light, and half choked by the reeking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
atmosphere, while I looked round to discover the
trencher-capped <i>Wirth</i>. If <i>The Sun</i> had no room,
what was to be hoped for here? However, the landlord,
after a consultation with his wife, assured me of a
chamber to myself; and placing a chair at the only
vacant end of one of the tables, professed himself ready
to supply "anything" for supper. He rung the changes
on beef, veal, and sausage, with interpolation of roast
goose. The meats were good, but the goose was prime;
he could recommend that "<i>vom Herzen</i>," and he laid his
hand on his heart as he said it. So I accepted roast
goose; and presently a smoking dish of the savoury bird
was set before me, with cucumber salad and rye bread.
The landlord had not overpraised his Bohemian cookery,
for he gave me a most relishing supper.</p>

<p>As my eyes became accustomed to the smoky atmosphere,
the forms and features of the company came out
more distinct than at first. Among the wagoners and
rustics who made up the greater number, I saw two or
three heads of a superior cast&mdash;unmistakable Czechish
heads&mdash;in marked contrast to the rest. A gentleman
with his wife and brother, travelling to their estates,
preferred quarters in the <i>Herrnhaus</i> to a midnight stage,
and sat eating their supper, apparently not less pleased
with their entertainment than I was. By their side sat
half a dozen tramping shoemakers, each busy with a
plate of roast goose; and next to them, in the narrow
space between the stove and the wall, lay a woman and
her two children, sleeping on straw. The musicians
came round for a largesse, and, reanimated by success,
played a few tunes by way of finish, which made sitting
still almost impossible. Every one seemed inclined to
spring up and dance; and the host and his servants ran
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
to and fro quicker than ever, under the new excitement.
No sooner was a tankard emptied, than, following the
custom of the country, it was caught up by one of the
nimble attendants and refilled, without any asking leave
or any demur, except on the part of one of the guests.
Trencher-cap would by no means believe that I could
be satisfied with a single measure, and I had to compromise
for a glass of wine, which, when brought, he assured
me proudly was genuine '34 <i>Adelsberger</i>. Whether
or no, it was very good.</p>

<p>Presently he asked for a sight of my passport, that his
son might enter my name with those of the other travellers.
I spread the document before him on the
table; he bent down and examined it curiously, as an
antiquary over a wormeaten manuscript, but with a look
of utter bewilderment, for he had never before seen an
English passport. He turned it upside down, sideways,
aslant, back to front, every way, in short, in his endeavour
to discover a meaning in it; but in vain. He
caught eagerly at the British Minister's eagle, and the
German <i>visas</i>, yet found nothing to enlighten him
therein. His son then took a turn in the examination;
still with no better result; and the two looked at one
another in blank hopelessness.</p>

<p>Presently the father, recollecting himself, beckoned
secretly to one of the soldiers, who came to help solve
the mystery. Taking the passport, he held it at arm's
length, turned it every way as the <i>Wirth</i> had done
before, brought it close to his eyes; but could make
nothing of it. Then, as if to assist his wit, he hooked
one finger on the end of his nose, spread the mysterious
document on the table, and pointing to the first paragraph,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
which, as tourists know, stands printed in good
round hand, he began to read at all hazards:</p>

<p>"<i>Vill&mdash;Vill&mdash;Vill&mdash;yam. Ja, ja. Villyam.</i> Ah!
that's English!" Then he attacked the second word&mdash;"<i>Fre&mdash;Fre&mdash;Fre&mdash;Fredrich.
Ja, ja.</i> That is English!"</p>

<p>The next word, <i>Earl</i>, looked awkward, so, skipping
that, he went on with many flourishes of his forefinger,
"<i>Cla&mdash;ren&mdash;don. Ja, ja. Clarendon.</i> That's English!"</p>

<p>Encouraged by success, he made a dash at the following
word, "<i>Baron</i>," and stopped suddenly short, hooked
his finger once more on his nose, stood for a minute as
if in deep study, then repeating slowly, "<i>Villyam Fredrich
Clarendon, Baron</i>," he gave the passport back into
the landlord's hands, and said in a whisper, pointing
slily to me, "He's a Baron."</p>

<p>Hereupon the son, with nimble pen, entered me in the
book as "<i>Villyam Fredrich Clarendon, Baron</i>."</p>

<p>"You have made a pretty mistake," I interposed.
"See, that's my name, written lower down, quite away
from the titles of our Foreign Minister." But it was in
vain that I spoke, and argued, and protested, the opposite
party would not be convinced, and Trencher-cap,
folding up the passport, looked at me with that expression
which very knowing folk are apt to assume, and
said, as he replaced it in my hand, "<i>Ja, ja.</i> We are
used to that sort of thing. You wish not to travel in
your real name. Yes, yes, we know. <i>Herr Baron</i>, I
give you back your passport."</p>

<p>I reiterated my protest, and vehemently; but all in
vain. "<i>Herr Baron</i>" I had to remain for all the rest
of the evening. Trencher-cap made a bow every time
he addressed me, and went among his guests, telling
them he had caged an English Baron. One and another
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
came and sat near me for awhile, and talked with so
much of deference, that at last I felt quite ashamed of
myself&mdash;as if I were an accomplice in a hoax. The
talk, however, was very barren; the only items of real
information it brought forth were, that a good many
needles were made in the neighbourhood, and that
Buchau could muster ninety-nine master shoemakers.</p>

<p>So it went on till eleven o'clock, when mine host,
approaching with another bow, said, "<i>Herr Baron</i>, are
you quite sure that it is a cold foot-bath you want?"</p>

<p>"Quite."</p>

<p>"I told the maid so," he replied; "but she says she
cannot believe that a <i>Herr Baron</i> will have cold water,
and thinks it should be lukewarm."</p>

<p>Satisfied on this point, he summoned the incredulous
maid to light me to bed. She stooped low with what
was meant for a curtsey, and would on no account turn
her face from me, but went backwards up the stairs,
holding the candle low, and begging me at every step
not to stumble.</p>

<p>"Verily," thought I, "the whole household joins in
the conspiracy."</p>

<p>She carried the candlestick delicately, as if it were of
silver and not mere iron, placed it on a little deal table
in the bedroom with a ceremonious air, made another
low curtsey, and retreated to the door.</p>

<p>Then, with one hand on the latch, she said, after a
momentary pause, "<i>Herr Baron</i>, I wish you a good
night;" and withdrew, leaving me alone to sleep as best
I might under the burden of an unexpected title.

<h2>CHAPTER VIII.</h2>

</p>

<p class="p2">Neither nightmare nor anything else disturbed me
till the wagoners, hooking on their teams amid noisy
shouts, filed off in two directions from the square, at the
earliest peep of dawn. The quiet that returned on their
departure was ere long broken by a succession of wild
and discordant cries, which, being puzzled to account
for by ear, I got out of bed and used my eyes. The
gooseherd stood in the middle of the square, calling his
flock together from all quarters, with a voice, as it
seemed to me, more expressive of alarm and anger than
of invitation. However, the geese understood it, and
they came waddling and quacking forth from every
gateway and lane, and the narrow openings between
the houses, till some hundreds were gathered round the
herd, who, waving his long rod, kept up his cries till
the last straggler had come up, and then drove them
out to the dewy pasture beyond the village. A singular
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
effect was produced by the multitude of long necks, and
the awkward movements of the snow-white mass, accompanied
as they were by a ceaseless rise and fall of the
quacking chorus. Such a sight is common in Bohemia;
for your Bohemian has a lively relish for roast goose,
regarding it as a national dish; and mindful of his
neighbours, he breeds numbers of the savoury fowl
for their enjoyment. Walk over the <i>Erzgebirge</i> in
September, and you will meet thousands of geese in
a flock, waddling slowly on their way to Leipzig, and
the fulfilment of their destiny in German stomachs, at
the rate of about three leagues a day.</p>

<p>I doubted not that when the landlord had a fair look
at me by daylight, he would recall the title conferred
amid the smoke and excitement of the evening before.
But, no! he met me at the foot of the stair with the
same profound bow; hoped <i>Herr Baron</i> had slept well;
and would <i>Herr Baron</i> take breakfast; all my remonstrances
to the contrary notwithstanding. I drank my
coffee with a suspicion that the sounding honour would
have to be paid for; but I did the worthy man injustice,
for when summoned to receive payment, he brought his
slate and piece of chalk, and writing down the several
items, made the sum total not quite a florin. Not often
is a Baron created on such very reasonable terms.</p>

<p>Even after I left his door, the host continued his attentions:
he would go with me to the edge of the village,
and point out the way to the castle, and the shortest
way back to the main road. He must tell me, too,
that the church was dedicated to St. Michael the Archangel;
and of a spring not far off, known among the
visitors as the "iron spring." Then, as we shook hands
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
and parted, he made another low bow, and hoped I
would recommend all my friends to seek for entertainment
under his sign. It would be ungracious not to
comply with his wish; so should any of my friends have
the patience or courage to read these pages, and an inclination
to visit Buchau, I hereby counsel them to tarry
at the <i>Herrnhaus</i>.</p>

<p>The castle, or rather the ruin, rises on the summit of
a rounded hill about a mile from the village. There is
but little in them to charm either the eye or the fancy,
for their name and place recall nothing that lingers in
the memory. A few words suffice to tell that here once
stood the castle of Hartenstein, otherwise Hungerberg,
sheltering knights as lawless as any reiving Johnstone,
till King George Podiebrad, intolerant of their wild ways,
rooted them out in 1468, and knocked their stronghold
to pieces. He showed them the less mercy, from having
had, the year before, to lay siege for twelve weeks to a
castle near Raudnitz, held by conspirators who set him
at defiance. Engelhaus, as is believed, felt the first
touch of ruin some fifty years later.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the half-hour spent in the excursion is
not time lost, for the spiral path that winds round the
hill is well-nigh hidden by wild flowers&mdash;a right royal
carpet, and perfumed withal, swept by all the breezes.
And then there is always the view while you scramble
about among the broken walls and bits of towers, getting
peeps at parts of the landscape framed by a shattered
window. It is something to note how unvarying is the
scenery: hills shaped like barn roofs; the same undulations;
vast fields; a few ponds; dark masses of firs, lacking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
somewhat of cheerfulness notwithstanding the sunshine;
and the village in the midst of all, an irregular patch of
gray and white. Far as eye can reach it is the same,
and so shall we find it all the way to Prague.</p>

<p>The wind increased mightily while I was on the hill,
and as it swept coldly over the broad slopes of grain and
clover, the whole landscape seemed to become a great,
green, rippling sea.</p>

<p>My recollections of this day include&mdash;a flock of geese
grazing on a bit of common about every league; men
leading oxen by a strip of hide to pasture on the roadside
grass; women cutting fodder in nooks and corners;
shepherds, whose booted legs gave them anything but a
pastoral appearance; rows of cherry-trees, and the guards
in straw huts keeping watch over the fruit; and miles
of road irksomely straight between plum-trees.</p>

<p>Here and there you come to a homestead or <i>Gasthaus</i>,
surrounded by a high and thick whitewashed wall, with
one or more arched gateways, as if the inmates could
not give up the mediæval habit of living within a
fortress. On approaching Liebkowitz, the pale colour
of the land changes to a warm red, and fields of peas
which seem endless, and small plantations of hops, diversify
the surface, and contrast with the village, where
the clean white pillars of the gateways, the red roofs,
topped here and there with a purple ball, engage your eye.</p>

<p>At Lubenz, where the main road, with its bordering of
tall poles and telegraphic wire turns aside to the Saatzer
Circle, I struck into the direct route for Prague, and
keeping on at an easy pace, getting a passing view of
Schloss Petersburg on the right&mdash;a factory-like building&mdash;I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
came at eventide to the <i>Gasthof zum Rose</i> at
Willenz.</p>

<p>There is many a chapel in England smaller than the
common room at the <i>Rose</i>, and the same may be said
of nearly every roadside inn at which I stayed. Large
as the rooms are, it is sometimes difficult to find a seat
among the numerous guests; and on Sundays especially
they are overcrowded. Here in one corner stood the
stove enclosed by a dresser, on which all the preparations
for cooking were carried on; and, in the opposite
corner, the bar behind a wooden fence, running up to
the ceiling. Bread, smoked sausage, <i>schnaps</i>, and liqueurs,
are served from the bar; beer is fetched directly
from the cellar.</p>

<p>The host was thrifty, and kept his four daughters
busy in waiting on customers. The eldest presided at
the stove, and the other three went continually to and
fro, refilling the tankards of beer-drinkers, or dealing
out delicacies from the bar. Comely damsels they were,
dressed in purple bodices, and pink skirts that trailed
on the floor in all the amplitude prescribed by the milliners
at Paris. I could not fail to be struck by the frequency
of their visits to the cellar to supply the demands
of about twenty men, who, seated at one of the tables,
appeared to have been making a day of it. Tankard
after tankard was swallowed with marvellous rapidity,
and still the cry was "more." For the first time, in
my few trips to the Continent, I saw drunkards, and
these were not the only sots that came before me during
the present journey: all, however, within Bohemia.</p>

<p>Casual customers would now and then drop in, call
for beer, drink a small quantity, and leave the tankard
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
standing on the table and go away for half an hour, then
return, take another gulp, and so on. One of the tables
was covered by these drink-and-come-again tankards,
and though all alike in appearance, I noticed that every
man knew his own again. Among these bibbers by instalments
the landlord was conspicuous, for he took a
gulp from his tankard every five minutes, and never left
it a moment empty.</p>

<p>Now and then slouched in a troop of dusty-booted
wagoners, who drank a cup of coffee, and went slouching
forth to their wearisome journey. At times a half-dozen
peasants strode noisily in, and refreshed themselves
with a draught of beer for their walk home; and
sausage and little broils were in constant request. The
host rubbed his hands, and well he might, for trade was
brisk; and when he brought me a baked chicken&mdash;which,
by the way, is another favourite dish in Bohemia&mdash;for
my supper, and heard my praise of his beer, he
told me that he brewed his own beer and grew his own
hops. "You will see two big pockets of hops on the
landing when you go to bed," he added, with the look
of an innkeeper thoroughly self-satisfied. And then he
sat down and gave his two sons a writing-lesson.</p>

<p>After supper, one of the pink-robed damsels placed a
wooden candlestick, nearly a yard in height, on the table,
and brought the inevitable book&mdash;that miscellaneous collection
of travellers' autographs, kept for the edification
of the Imperial police. More inquisitorial than any
I had yet seen, this book contained three columns, in
one of which I had to note whether I was married or
single; "Catholic or other beliefed;" acquainted with
any one in any of the places I intended to visit, or not!
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span></p>

<p>Having entered the required particulars, the damsel
leaning over the page the while, I asked her what use
would be made of them?</p>

<p>"The gendarme comes to look at the book," she answered,
"and if he found the columns empty, so would
he blame my father sorely, and wake you up with loud
noise to ask the reason. Ah! sometimes he comes before
bedtime; sometimes not till midnight, when all
folk are asleep. Then must doors be opened and questions
answered; and if he discovers some one in bed
whose name is not yet in the book, then he makes great
outcry, and my father must pay a fine, and the stranger
must to the guard-house if he have not good passport.
Truly, the law is strong over the book."</p>

<p>Happy land! Paternal government is so careful of the
governed, so anxious to encourage sedentary virtues,
that no one is allowed to go more than four hours, about
twelve miles, from home without a passport or ticket of
residence (<i>Heimathschein</i>); and should any one not quite
so tame as his fellows wish to overpass the prescribed
limit, paternal government not unfrequently keeps him
waiting three days for the precious permit, or refuses it
altogether. In a town which we shall come to by-and-by,
I saw a poor woman, who begged leave to visit
one of her children some fifteen miles distant, turned
away with an uncompromising denial. Think of this,
my countrymen!&mdash;Islanders free to jaunt or journey
whithersoever ye will: be ye mighty or mean&mdash;even
ticket-of-leave holders.</p>

<p>Whatever the cause, the regulations concerning passports
are in Bohemia very rigorous. It may be that the
people have not forgotten they once had a king of their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
own, or that a remarkable intellectual movement is
taking place among the Czechs, or that a simmering up
of Protestantism has become chronic within the ring of
mountains; whatever the cause, the pressure of authority's
heaviest hand is manifest. For my own part&mdash;to
mention a little thing among great things&mdash;I was more
fidgetted about my passport in Bohemia than ever anywhere
else.</p>

<p>It is worse in Hungary. In that province the burden
of oppression is felt to a degree inconceivable by an
Englishman. Passports for France or England were
peremptorily refused to Hungarians of whatever degree
during the year 1855; and in 1856, when the rigour
was somewhat relaxed, leave was granted for three
months only. And should any one be known to have
paid a visit to Kossuth while in London, even though he
might believe the exile to be a better orator than ruler,
he would find the discipline of imprisonment awaiting
him on his return <i>home</i>. Think of Albert Smith,
or any other enterprising tourist, having to ask Lord
Clarendon's permission to steam up the Rhine, ascend
Mont Blanc, or travel anywhither! 'Tis well the
Magyars are not a hopeless race.</p>

<p>The members of the Hungarian Academy at Pesth
are not allowed to hold their weekly meetings unless an
Imperial Commissioner be present to watch the proceedings,
and stop the discussion of forbidden subjects. Not
a word must be spoken concerning politics, or liberty
in any form. History is tolerated only when she discourses
of antiquities&mdash;urns, buildings, dress and manners,
philology, or art. Science even must wear fetters,
and preserve herself demure and orthodox. A speculative
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
philosopher might as well attempt to utter high
treason, as to read a paper demonstrating by geological
proofs the countless ages of the earth's existence, or to
quote a chapter from the <i>Vestiges of Creation</i>. This
work is included among the prohibited books, of which
a list is sent to the Academy once a week. One copy
of the <i>Times</i>&mdash;a solitary feather from Liberty's wing&mdash;finds
its way into Pesth: a rare indulgence for the
Englishman who reads it. Imagine Sir Richard Mayne
sitting at meetings of the Royal Society, with power to
stop Sir Roderick Murchison in his Silurian evidences;
or the Rev. Baden Powell in his speculations and inferences
concerning the <i>Unity of Worlds</i>; or the utterance
of Professor Faraday's opinions concerning gravitation;
and telling them they shall not read Hugh Miller's
<i>Testimony of the Rocks</i>!</p>

<p>But to return. Among those who dropped in was a
tall, grizzly peasant, who presently began a talk with
me about what he called his sad condition. His lot was
a hard one, because the country was kept down; and
hoping for better times would be vain while France and
England maintained their alliance. All who felt themselves
aggrieved&mdash;and their number was great&mdash;saw no
prospect of redress but in a new outbreak of strife between
those two nations; let that only come, and from
the Rhine to the Vistula all would be in revolution,
wrong would be punished, and the right prevail. He
knew many a peasant who was of the same way of
thinking.</p>

<p>Not being able to flatter him with hopes of a rupture
between the Lion and the Cock, I suggested his taking
the matter into his own hands, and making the best of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
present circumstances. Thrift and diligence would do
him more good than a revolution. Whereupon he told
me how he lived; how hard he worked to cultivate his
plot of ground; how rarely he ate anything besides
bread and potatoes; and as for beer, it was never seen
under his roof.</p>

<p>"Do you think it fair, then," I rejoined, "to sit here
drinking? Why not carry home a measure of beer, and
let your wife share it?"</p>

<p>He made no answer; but rose from his seat, shook
me by the hand, and walked heavily away.

</p>

<p class="p2">A hilly site, gardens, orchards, and green slopes,
houses scattered at random among chestnuts and elders,
and a general suspicion of Czechish carelessness, give
to Willenz a touch of the picturesque: at least, when
seen as I saw it, with the morning dew yet glistening
on thatch, and flowers, and branches. Cherry-trees
form a continuous avenue up the hill beyond, and here
and there huts of fir branches were built against a stem,
to shelter the guard set to watch the ripened fruit, and
gatherers were busy aloft. You may pluck a cherry
now and then with impunity; but not from the trees
marked by a wisp of straw twisted round a conspicuous
branch, for of those the fruit is sold, and the watchman
eyes them jealously.</p>

<p>Coming to the brow of the hill, I saw what seemed
a giant standing on a high bank above the road. It
was the grizzly peasant magnified through a thin haze.
As soon as he saw me he came plunging down the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">97</a></span>
bank, gave me a cheerful "<i>Gut' Morgen</i>," seized my
hand, and said, "I have been waiting long to see you.
I talk gladly with such as you, and could not let you go
without asking whether you will come back this way.
If so, then pray come to my house for a night. It is
not far from Schloss Petersburg. We will make you
comfortable."</p>

<p>To return by the same road was no part of my plan,
and when I told him so, the old man's countenance
fell; he pressed my hand tighter, and cried, with a
tone of disappointment, "Is it true? Ah! my wife will
be so sorry. I told her what you said, and she wanted
to see you as much as I."</p>

<p>As there was no help for it, we had another talk, he
all the while holding my hand as if fearful I should
escape. The burden of his discourse was "a good time
coming," mingled, however, with a dread that when it
came it would not be half so desirable as the good old
times, and between the past and future his life was a
torment.</p>

<p>"Whether you shall be miserable or not," I answered,
"depends more on yourself than on the rulers of
Bohemia. Why should a man grumble who has a
house, and food, and land to cultivate? Only carry
your enjoyments home instead of consuming them by
the way, and cheerfulness will be there to gladden your
wife as well as you."</p>

<p>"Yes; but in the old times&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>I bade him good-bye, and pursued my walk. Turning
round just over the brow of the hill, I saw him still
in the same spot, gazing after me. "Farewell, good
friend!" he shouted, and strode away.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span></p>

<p>Half an hour later I came to a road-mender, who
told me he earned twenty kreutzers a day, and was
quite content therewith. He had a wife and child;
never ate meat or drank beer; lived mostly on potatoes,
and was, nevertheless, strong and healthy, and by no
means inclined to quarrel with his lot. The road was a
constant source of employment; and if at times bad
weather kept him at home for a day or two, his pay
went on all the same.</p>

<p>I mentioned my interview with the old peasant.
"Ah!" he answered, laughing, "it is always so. No
grumbler like a <i>Bauer</i>. All the world knows that
peasants think everybody better off than themselves"&mdash;and
down came his hammer with crashing force on a
lump of granite. Wayside philosophy clearly had the
best of it, and heartily approved the fable of the <i>Mountain
of Miseries</i> which I narrated.</p>

<p>Every mile brings us more and more among the
Czechs. Oval faces and arched eyebrows become more
numerous, and women's talk sounds shrill and shrewish,
as if angry or quarrelsome, as is remarked of the women
in Caernarvonshire; and yet it is nothing more than
friendly conversation. To a stranger the language
sounds as unmusical as it is difficult; and to learn it&mdash;you
may as well hope to master Chinese. Czechish
names and handbills appear on the walls; the names of
villages, with the usual topographical particulars, are
written up in German and Czechish, of which behold a
specimen:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span></p>

<div class="figcenter">

</table>

<p class="p2">In some of the villages no one but the landlord of the
best inn can speak German, and you have only your
eyes by which to study the natives and their ways.
For my own part, my Czechish vocabulary being
foolishly short, I could not ask the villagers why they
preferred sluttishness to tidiness, though I longed to do
so. It comprised three words only: <i>Piwo</i>, <i>Chleb</i>, <i>Máslo</i>&mdash;Beer,
Bread, Butter.</p>

<p>Crosses are frequent, erected at the corners where bye-roads
branch off. Not the huge wooden things you see
in Tyrol; but light iron crucifixes, graceful in form
and brightly gilt, and mounted on a stone pedestal.
Nearly all have been set up by private individuals to
commemorate some family event: <i>By the married Pair</i>,
you may read on one; <i>Dedicated to the Honour of God,
by two Sisters</i>, on another; <i>In Memory of my Daughter,
by Peter Schmidt, Bauer</i>, on a third&mdash;all apparently from
some pious motive.</p>

<p>While eating a crust under the pretentious sign,
<i>Stadt Carlsbad</i>, at Horosedl, I saw how the dowager
hostess practised her domestic economy. She was preparing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
dinner for the family, after her manner, drawing
her hand repeatedly across her nose, for the stove was
hot and the day sultry. She sliced cucumbers with an
instrument resembling a plane, sprinkled the slices with
salt, then squeezed them well between her hands, and
exposed them to the sun in a shallow basket, one of five
or six which, woven almost as close and water-tight as
calabashes, served her as dishes. Then she grated a
lump of hard brown dough, and used the coarse grains
to thicken the soup&mdash;a substitute for vermicelli common
among the peasantry.</p>

<p>The hostess, meanwhile, chatted with me and set the
table. She professed to admire the English, and thought
it an honour that an Englishman had once slept a night
in her house, "although he had to look into a book for
all he wanted to say." She coincided entirely in the
Saxon schoolmaster's opinion, that all best things came
from England.</p>

<p>As the clock struck eleven in came half a dozen
serving men and maidens, and sat down to dinner with
the master and mistress. The dowager supplied them
with soup, beef, a mountain of potato-dumplings, and
cucumber salad, and ate her portion apart with undoubting
appetite. An old beggar crept in and stood
hat in hand imploring charity for God's sake! She
scolded him for his intrusion, and then gave him a
smoking hot dumpling and a word of sympathy, which
he received and acknowledged with humble thanks and
the sign of the cross.</p>

<p>It is a relief along this part of the road to see frequent
hop plantations, and here and there rocks as
richly red as the crimson cliffs of Sidmouth, while at
rarer intervals a pale mass of sandstone on a distant
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
hill-slope puts on the appearance of an enormous antediluvian
fossil. I was pacing briskly along, enjoying a
fresh breeze that had sprung up, when I heard a voice
behind me: "<i>Ach!</i> at last. I saw you from far, and
said to myself, Perhaps that is a journey-companion&mdash;let
me overtake him."</p>

<p>Immediately a man, who walked as if he enjoyed the
exercise, and wore what looked like his Sunday suit,
came up to my side, and proposed to join company, so
as to shorten the way with talk. We soon got through
the preliminaries, and started topics enough to last all
the rest of the day. The stranger notified himself as a
<i>Mechaniker</i> from Neudeck, going to Prague on business
for his master. He, too, had much to say in praise of
England. He had once worked with an Englishman, a
certain James, or <i>Ya-mes</i>, as he pronounced it, and had
ever since held him in the highest esteem and admiration.
"That was a man!" he exclaimed; "if all Englishmen
are the same, no wonder their nation is so
great."</p>

<p>English files also were not less praiseworthy&mdash;a fact
of which Sheffield ought to be proud, seeing that her
handicraft has often been reproached of late. "To
dance," said the <i>Mechaniker</i>, "is not more pleasure than
to file with an English file. How it bites, and lasts so
long! Even an old one that has been thrown away for
months is better than a German file. One is honest
steel&mdash;the other is too much like lead." Some folk
will, perhaps, feel surprised by this scrap of experimental
testimony in favour of Hallamshire.</p>

<p>We talked about wages. The <i>Mechaniker's</i> earnings
were six hundred florins a year; a small sum, as it
seems, to English notions for a skilled workman in
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
machinery&mdash;one held in high consideration by his
master. Ordinary workmen get one-third less; he was,
therefore, well content, and told me he could spare something
for the savings bank, but not so much as formerly,
owing to the increased price of provisions.</p>

<p>So with sundry discourse we came to Kruschowitz,
where we dined, looking out on thick belts of fruit-trees,
that embower the village, and relieve the pale
green of little plantations of acacias that show here and
there among the bright-red roofs. Most of the houses
exhibit the Czechish style, which shuns height and dispenses
with an upper story. Then we went on at an
after-dinner pace to Rentsch, where, striking into the
old road to Prague, now but little frequented, we
shortened the distance by four or five miles. All
Czechish now, both to eye and ear. A difference is
perceptible in the fields, the implements, sheds, and
vehicles; they are not so neat or workmanlike in
appearance as in the German districts, and yet the
broad crops of wheat, already turning yellow, betoken
glad abundance.</p>

<p>Now we found pleasant footpaths through the beech-woods
that border the road, and enjoyed the cool shade
and the sound of rustling leaves. The men we met
had a slouching gait, and the women, wearing coarse,
baggy cotton stockings, and flimsy cotton gowns, and
shabby kerchiefs on their heads, were unmistakable
dowdies&mdash;an appearance which has come to be considered
essentially Celtic. However, they failed not to
salute us with their "<i>dobrýtro</i>" (good day) as we passed.</p>

<p>The aspect of Neu Straschitz, the next village on our
way, shows how we are getting into the heart of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
country&mdash;the land of the Czechs. Wide streets, which
make the low whitewashed houses look still lower than
they are; a great, uneven square, patched here and
there with ragged grass, bestrewn with rough logs of
timber, ornamented at one side by a row of saplings, unhappy
looking, as if pining for the rank of trees; on the
other by a statue of St. John Nepomuk. Very lifeless!
No merry noise of children in summer evening gambols;
no fathers and mothers chatting in the cool
lengthening shadows. The only living creatures are a
man, a woman, and a dog, all three as far apart as
possible. There is nothing stirring even around the
<i>Bezirksamt</i> or the church.</p>

<p>Glazed windows are few: an opening in the wall,
with a hinged shutter, suffices for most of the houses.
And for door they have a big archway closed by heavy
wooden gates, looking very inhospitable. Here and
there one of these gates stands a little open, and you
may get a peep at the interior, a square court, enclosed
by stable, barn, and dwelling, heaped with manure and
ugly rubbish. No notion here, you will say, of the
fitness of things. Look at the wagon&mdash;a basket on
wheels&mdash;the wheelbarrow, the rakes, huddled away
anyhow, as if they were just as well in one place as
another. Perhaps they are. Quaint old Fuller says
of the Devonshire cotters of his day, "Vain it is for
any to search their houses, being a work beneath the
pains of a sheriff, and above the power of any constable."
You will, perhaps, say the same here. Look
in-doors! the same slovenliness prevails. The room would
be just as comfortable, or rather uncomfortable, if chairs
and table changed places; if the higgledy-piggledy at
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
one end were shifted to the other. The condition of the
utensils is by no means unimpeachable; and repelled by
the pervading odour, you will not be less thankful than
proud that your lot is not cast among the Czechs.</p>

<p>The inn is an exception, and has the appearance of
being too good for the village. The <i>Kellnerinn</i> told us
we could have as many bedrooms as we chose, for
they were all empty. I was content with my day's
walk, about twenty-five miles; but the <i>Mechaniker</i>,
impatient to arrive at Prague, resolved to travel two
hours farther; so, after he had finished his tankard of
beer, we shook hands, and he went on alone, the
<i>Kellnerinn</i> assuring him as he departed that he would
find good sleeping quarters almost every half-hour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER X.</h2>

<p class="hanging">
A Talk with the Landlord&mdash;A Jew's Offer&mdash;A Ride in a Wagen&mdash;Talk
with the Jew&mdash;The Stars&mdash;A Mysterious Gun-barrel&mdash;An Alarm&mdash;Stony
Ammunition&mdash;The Man with the Gun&mdash;The Jew's opinion of

Kleinseite&mdash;The Bridge&mdash;Palaces&mdash;The Altstadt&mdash;Remarkable Streets&mdash;The
Teinkirche&mdash;The Neustadt&mdash;The Three Hotels.
</p>

<p class="p2">The landlord came in a few minutes afterwards, and,
to encourage me to tell him all he wished to know about
myself, declared himself a German. That he should
ever have been so stupid as to tempt fortune at Neu
Straschitz was a mistake haunting and vexing him continually.
A living was not to be got in such a miserable
village, and among such miserable people, and he meant
to migrate as soon as he could find some one more stupid
than himself to take the inn off his hands.</p>

<p>I had seen two or three German names in the street,
and asked him if they were of long standing. "Not
very." And he went on to say that the Stock-Bohemians,
as the Czechs are called, are perpetually encroached
on, pressed within narrower limits by the German
element. Though a good deal was said about Czechish
vigour and intellectuality, some folk thought that the
language would at no distant day cease to be spoken.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
As for the character of the Czechs, there was scarcely a
German who did not believe them to be sly, false,
double-faced. And what says the proverb?&mdash;Dirt is
the offspring of Lying and Idleness. For his part, he
knew the Czechs were dirty, but he didn't quite know
whether, in other respects, they were worse than their
neighbours. Any way, he rather liked the thought of
removing from among them.</p>

<p>After all this, mine host thought he had a fair claim
on me for a sight of an English gold coin, and answers
to all his questions concerning England. I was doing
my best to satisfy him, when the <i>Kellnerinn</i> called my
attention to a <i>Herr</i> who was going to start with his
<i>Wagen</i> in the course of the evening for Prague; and
she suggested, very disinterestedly as it seemed to me,
that the opportunity was too good to be lost.</p>

<p><i>Wagen</i> is as comprehensive a word as our "conveyance:"
the <i>Herr</i> looked like a man who might be going
to Prague in a carriage, so, as he promised plenty of room,
and asked no more than a florin for the twenty miles,
I accepted his offer. Having yet business to settle, he
went out, and promised to call for me at nine o'clock.
He had no sooner left the room, than the landlord said,
"He is a Jew; but you need not be afraid of him. He
is a very honest fellow, and comes here often."</p>

<p>I saw no reason to be afraid, and when the Jew came
back at the appointed hour was ready to accompany
him. He led the way to a back street, where we waited
in front of one of the low, undemonstrative houses.
Presently the big gate swung back, and out came the
<i>Wagen</i>&mdash;one of the four-wheeled basket wagons, drawn
by a single horse pulling awkwardly at one side of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
heavy pole. I had imagined something a little better
than that; however, as the wagon was half full of new
hay, with a comfortable back-cushion of clover, I
scrambled in on one side while the Jew did the same
on the other, and the driver, a Czech, perched himself
uncomfortably on a bar in front.</p>

<p>The wagon was just wide enough for two; and,
what with the elastic sides and soft hay, there was
no painful jolting. The west shone gloriously with
the golden arch of sunset as we drove out of the
village and entered on a bad road winding across the
open fields; and Twilight came on so softly that you
might have fancied Day was lingering to lend her his
palest rays. The Jew was disposed to talk, and betrayed
no little curiosity on the subject of travelling. Was it
not very irksome to be away from home? was it not very
expensive? and how much money did one need to
carry? was there no danger? and so forth. But what
interested him most was the question as to the money:
he returned to it again and again.</p>

<p>Next, he had much to ask concerning London&mdash;the
sort of business transacted in the great city&mdash;the rate of
profit&mdash;in short, he put me through a whole social and
commercial catechism, from which he drew a conclusion
that London would not be an undesirable place of residence.</p>

<p>So it went on, interrupted only by his saying a few
words now and then to the driver in Czechish, until my
turn came, and I opened my questioning about Prague.
The Jew, however, was readier in asking questions than
in answering; indeed, he was stingy in reply, as if
words were worth a florin the dozen.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span></p>

<p>As the stars brightened the night became cold, and
set me shivering. The Jew brought two cloaks out of
a bag, and, wrapped in one of these, I lay on my back
looking up at the sky, thinking of home-scenes and
home-friends as my eye wandered from one bright spot
to another; and solemn was the impression made on me
by the sight of the glorious handiwork.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"For the bright firmament</p>
<p class="i1">Shoots forth no flame</p>
<p>So silent, but is eloquent</p>
<p class="i1">In speaking the Creator's name."</p>
</div></div>

<p>I could not fail to note that astronomers have reason
for telling us that meteoric phenomena are more common
on any night than would be believed by those not
accustomed to observe the heavens, for I saw twelve
shooting-stars within two hours.</p>

<p>As we went on, the lights in the public-houses became
fewer, and ere long disappeared, and the silence
was only disturbed by the fitful barking of dogs in the
distance, and the slow noise of the wheels. Our horse
dropped into a walk, and the driver off to sleep, and I
was still gazing at the stars when I heard footsteps near
the side of the wagon. Turning my eyes, without
rising, I saw the top of a gun-barrel about two yards off,
apparently resting on some one's shoulder. The sound
of the footsteps woke the driver, who immediately
began to quicken the horse's pace, but very cautiously,
as if to avoid suspicion. The Jew seemed uneasy, and
muttered a word or two in a low tone; the whip was
used, the horse broke into a trot, but the gun-barrel was
not left behind; I could still see it in the same place,
keeping pace with the wagon.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span></p>

<p>What did it mean? One time I fancied that perhaps
the hay on which I lay so innocently was but a disguise
for something contraband, whereof a cunning gendarme
had gotten scent. Then I remembered the landlord's
desire to see a gold coin, and the Jew's curiosity as to
the amount and quality of a traveller's money, and a
faint suspicion of having fallen into a trap did occur to
me. Meanwhile the horse trotted in earnest; the gun-barrel
was left in the rear; then the whip was plied
vigorously; the Jew spoke energetically; the driver
jumped from his perch, picked up two big stones, threw
them into the wagon, and drove quickly on again.</p>

<p>"There is one for you, and one for me," said the Jew
to me, in a loud whisper.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" I asked.</p>

<p>"The stones," he replied; "one for you, and one for
me, if we are attacked."</p>

<p>"Attacked or not, we are three to one, and one of the
three is an Englishman."</p>

<p>The Jew did not answer, for the footsteps were again
heard approaching at a run, and soon the gun-barrel
appeared once more abreast of the wagon. The driver
kept the horse up to his speed, the Jew fumbled about
with his feet for the big stones, and the chase&mdash;if such it
could be called&mdash;continued for about ten minutes.</p>

<p>All at once the gun-barrel darted from the road-side
towards the wagon. I immediately sat up, and found
myself face to face, and but a few inches apart, with the
bearer of the weapon&mdash;a wild-looking fellow, wearing a
slouched cap and hunting-jacket. A faint exclamation
of surprise escaped him, and, whether it was that he saw
two persons in the wagon, besides the driver, or that we
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
did not look worth his trouble, I know not, but he
gradually dropped behind, and we lost sight of the gun-barrel.</p>

<p>A minute passed. "Now," said the Jew, "we are
rid of him."</p>

<p>But scarcely had he spoken, than a shrill whistle
sounded afar through the silence of the night, followed
after a short interval by a whistle at a distance from the
road.</p>

<p>"Quick! quick!" was now the word to the driver.
"He is calling his comrades: they will be down upon
us. Quick! quick!"</p>

<p>The Czech seemed well inclined to obey; the pace
was quickened into a gallop, and, in about a quarter-hour,
we came to a village, where, stopping in front
of the inn, he filled the rack with clover from the
wagon, and gave the horse to feed.</p>

<p>The place with its littery appendages looked unked,
lying half in deep shadow; the door was fast, and not a
light shone from the windows, cheating my hope of a
cup of coffee. The Jew now sat up, talked for awhile
vehemently with the driver, then said, turning to me,
"We have had an escape. That fellow meant nothing
good&mdash;nothing good&mdash;nothing good. A real bad fellow!"</p>

<p>"Was he a robber?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps worse. He meant nothing good. We are
well out of it. I hope we shall not see him again."</p>

<p>We did not; and by-and-by, as we went on again,
and I lay looking up at the stars, they seemed to grow
dim, then twinkle strangely, and at last they disappeared.
It may be that I slept, for when next I looked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
at the sky it was flecked by streams of rosy tints, the
fields were covered with dew as a veil, and, by the
timid chirping of birds, and other signs, the eye might
note the preparations for lifting the veil at the approach
of the sun. My sheltering cloak, my hair and eyebrows,
were thickly covered with dew, cold as the
brightening dawn. The Jew, similarly bepearled, lay
sleeping soundly, the Czech nodded on his perch, and
the horse, taking advantage of the slumber, was moving
only at a sober walk.</p>

<p>It was not yet five when I alighted about three miles
from Prague, to get warm by walking the remaining
distance. The Jew took his florin with much demonstration
of thanks, horse and driver roused up, and the
wagon was soon out of sight.</p>

<p>A few minutes brought me to the <i>Weissenberg</i>&mdash;White
Hill&mdash;a battle-field not less fatal than famous.
The road is bordered by ample rows of trees; woods
thick with foliage clothe the neighbouring hollows and
acclivities, and on the left, sloping gently upwards, with
here and there a break, rises the hill. Here, then, was
the scene of which I had often read, where Frederick of
the Palatinate, who had married a princess of England,
daughter of James I., lost the crown of Bohemia.
Not long had he worn it&mdash;indeed, some of his contemporaries
called him the Winter King&mdash;when he was
forced to flee, with his wife and children, among them
the infant Rupert, who afterwards won renown as chief
of the Cavaliers in England. Treachery, as late researches
show, aided the combined forces of Ferdinand
of Austria and Maximilian of Bavaria, and from that
day Bohemia ceased to be an independent monarchy,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
and became a province of the Austrian Empire, a loss
yet mourned by many, who join in the poet's lament:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_128.jpg" width="316" height="94" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="poetry-container p2">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Ach Gott! die Weissenberger Schlacht</p>
<p>Erreicht wohl Ostrolenka's Trauer,</p>
<p>Und die darauf erfolgt die Racht,</p>
<p>Hat trübere als Sibiriens Schauer."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Terrible, indeed, was the <i>night</i> that followed! And
when one reads of Ferdinand's faithlessness and cruelty,
his murderous vengeance on the chiefest of the conquered
people, the wonder is not that Bohemia should
have revolted, but that she did not reconquer her birthright.</p>

<p>Thoughts of the past came crowding through my
mind as I paced across the ground, and presently pursued
my walk. I was approaching a city remarkable in
itself, and in its historical associations, but for the moment
my attention was drawn to immediate objects.
As I went on down the now continuous descent, the
tops of towers and spires came into view in the distance
below, and on either hand appeared indications that a
metropolis was not far off. Early folk were opening the
booths, shops, and public-houses, which, scattered among
the trees, presented ere long an unbroken line on both
sides of the road. Cooling drinks were set out on tables,
and many a shutter invited the passer-by to <i>Beer</i> and
<i>Brandy</i>, in various phrase. Now stalls covered with
cherries and currants alternate with piles of bread, hard-boiled
eggs, cheese, and smoked sausages; and working
people stop to eat their earliest breakfast. Every few
yards sits a woman with a basket of fresh, tempting
<i>Semmel</i>&mdash;fancy bread, as we should call it&mdash;most of the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
little loaves thickly sprinkled with poppy-seeds, dear to
the native palate. And here and there stands what
looks like a roomy sentry-box, painted yellow, and
adorned with the Austrian blazon&mdash;an <i>Imperial and
Royal Booth for the sale of Tobacco</i>.</p>

<p>Already the road is alive with vehicles, for from every
lane and byepath speed dog-carts, or little wagons on
two wheels, or large wagons on four wheels, all laden
with tin cans of milk for the city. How the dogs pant,
and the horses snort! for the driver, and his or her two
or three companions, keep the animals at full speed,
sparing neither lash nor voice. Long before they come
into sight you can hear their shrill chatter, mingled with
merry laughter, and, as they burst into view, a shout
from all the others adds excitement to the race, and away
they go, each trying to be first.</p>

<p>Half a mile farther, and I overtake many of them at
the turn of the road, where the women are sitting on
the bank, putting on stockings and shoes. Some remount
the wagons; others walk quietly onwards, showing
a neat ankle and clean white leg to the morning
sun. Now the city wall frowns towards you, and, once
round the turn, there is the gate&mdash;<i>Reichsthor</i>&mdash;a few
soldiers hanging about, and many persons passing to
and fro, while the curious towers of the Strahow monastery,
where Rupert was born, peer above trees and
vine-slopes on the right. I passed through the gloomy
arch unchallenged by any of the guards, and had got
some distance down the steep street, when a man made
me aware that shouts in the rear were intended for me.
I turned: a soldier, who had come a few yards from the
cavern-like gate, was making very peremptory use of his
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
voice, and, as soon as I saw him, he beckoned with angry
gestures. I retraced my steps, but at too slow a pace to
satisfy the Imperial functionary, for he turned again and
again, each time with the same impatient gesture. No
sooner did I come within earshot, than he cried, snappishly,
"Why did you not give me your passport?"</p>

<p>"For two reasons," I answered, with a laugh; "this
is my first visit to Prague, and I have not yet learnt
your regulations; and secondly, why did you let me go
by without asking me for it?"</p>

<p>The lounging group of soldiers laughed as this was
spoken, and my questioner having led the way to his
darksome den, built at the elbow of the arch so as to
command both approaches, took my passport and gave
me the official receipt without further parley.</p>

<p>As I emerged again into the sunshine, one of the
soldiers said, "Do you know what? When any one
goes away into the city without stopping at the guard-house,
he must always come back to the gate where he
entered, and give up his passport."</p>

<p>I thanked him for his information, and took my way
once more down the street. It was just six o'clock: all
the shops were open; working people thronged the footways;
heavy teams toiled slowly up the hill towards the
gate; the milk-folk hurried down with noisy clatter,
while men wearing glazed hats and a canvas uniform
swept the streets. Signs of early rising everywhere.</p>

<p>The peculiar features of the city multiply as you advance.
High on the left, its cathedral tower springing
above the rest, appears the Hradschin&mdash;an imposing mass
of building in the factory style of architecture, stretching,
as one might guess, for half a mile along the bold
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
eminence, commanding the country for miles around.
You can count four hundred windows. There, as every
one knows, the Thirty Years' War began, by certain
angry Bohemian nobles pitching two Imperial commissioners
and their secretary out of one of the windows.
Little did the haughty ejectors think of the consequences
of their exploit&mdash;that before thirty years were
over, 30,000 villages and more than a million men
would be destroyed by war!</p>

<p>Being very hungry, I was fain to drink a draught
of milk and eat one of the poppy-seeded loaves at the
door of one of the little shops, looking round all the
while on curious gables, panelled fronts, ancient gateways,
more numerous as we descend. Lower down, we
are in the oldest part of the city, among the palaces of
the great nobles whose names figure in history&mdash;Kollowrat,
Lobkowitz, Wallenstein, and others. Massive
edifices, whereby your eye and steps are alike arrested.
And on every side are narrow lanes and courts, some
nothing but a steep stair, and these, winding in and out,
increase the charm of the ornamented architecture, and
produce wonderful bits of perspective. Such effects of
light and shade, and glorious touches of colour!</p>

<p>Then a church crowded with carvings; old women
sitting on the steps, young women and matrons going
in to the early mass, of which, as the doors swing to and
fro, you hear the loud notes of the organ. Then a square,
and tall obelisk, and arcaded houses; and turning a
corner there rises the bridge tower, strikingly picturesque.
As my eye caught sight of its graceful roof
and slender finials, I could not repress an exclamation of
surprise and pleasure. Then through the narrow arch,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
and we are on the ancient bridge, looking down on the
broad stream of the Moldau, flowing with noisy rush
through the sixteen arches built 600 years ago; at
houses, palaces, and churches rising one above another
in the <i>Kleinseite</i> through which we have just passed,
and in the <i>Altstadt</i> on the opposite side; at the mosaic
pavement; at the gigantic statues which terminate every
pier, noteworthy saints from the Bohemian calendar,
chiefest among them St. John Nepomuk, who with his
crescentic belt of five large ruby stars might be taken
for another Orion. In no city that I have yet seen have
I felt so much pleasure, or such varied emotions, as
during my walk into Prague.</p>

<p>Then we pass under the equally picturesque bridge
tower of the <i>Altstadt</i>, and enter narrow streets lined
with good shops, and full of bustle; and after many
puzzling ins and outs, we emerge into the spacious area
of the Ring&mdash;a lively scene, people crossing in all directions,
or sauntering under the arcades; here and there
sentries pacing up and down, and small parties of soldiers,
in gay uniforms, marching away to beat of drum.
And above the farther houses there shoot up the two
towers of the <i>Teinkirche</i>&mdash;one of the most famous
churches in Prague&mdash;which were built by George Podiebrad.
The church itself is screened by the houses; but,
whenever you see those graceful towers, you recognise
the site of the edifice which was one of the strongholds
of Hussite preachers, and where Tycho Brahe
lies buried.</p>

<p>More narrow streets; across the end of a market-place,
and passing under the arch of the ancient Powder
Tower, we enter the broad streets of the <i>Neustadt</i>. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
Bohemian professor at Würzburg had recommended me
to lodge at the <i>Blaue Stern</i>, so to the <i>Blue Star</i> I went,
and asked for a room.</p>

<p>"Quite full," said the <i>Kellner</i>, at the same time surveying
me inquisitively from head to foot.</p>

<p>Two doors off was another hotel, where the answer,
accompanied by a similar inquisition, was, "Nothing
empty."</p>

<p>A third replied, "Perhaps, to-morrow."</p>

<p>I began to fancy that my not having been in bed all
night&mdash;boots still dusty, and a few stalks of hay clinging
to my coat&mdash;might have something to do with these
denials. However, hotels are thickly grouped in this
quarter of the city, and not many yards farther the
<i>Schwarzes Ross</i>, in the <i>Kolowrat-strasse</i>, gave me quarters
as comfortable as could be wished.

</p>

<p class="p2">I had not been many minutes in my room when the
<i>Hausknecht</i>&mdash;the German boots&mdash;brought me a printed
form, in which, besides the inevitable particulars, I had
to state the probable duration of my stay in Prague. For
three days' residence the police authorities charge nothing,
but if you enter on a fourth day you must pay
two florins for a permit to reside. I escaped the tax by
not having more than three days to spare.</p>

<p>The day was all before me, and I made haste to</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="i9">"go lose myself,</p>
<p>And wander up and down and view the city."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Losing one's-self is not difficult in Prague&mdash;easier, indeed,
than in any city I have yet visited; for the
<i>Altstadt</i> so abounds in queer nooks and corners, narrow
streets and lanes all crooked and angular, running hither
and thither in such unexpected directions, or coming to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
a sudden stop, as completely to puzzle a stranger. Even
my organ of locality well-nigh failed me in the intricate
maze.</p>

<p>Among all these zigzags you discover the leading
thoroughfares only by the busy appearance, the continuous
stream of citizens going and coming, straggling
all across the narrow roadway, now darting aside to
escape a passing carriage, or slowly giving place to a
long lumbering dray that rolls past with deafening
rumble, the horses clattering on shoes with tall calkins
that put you in mind of pattens. Here, too, are the best
shops, displaying attractive wares behind coarse and
uneven panes. The booksellers' windows exhibit a good
variety of standard books, of maps and engravings, denoting
the existence of a wholesome love of literature;
very different from what is to be seen in the southern
states of the empire. Some shops display none but
Czechish books, and if you glance over the title-pages,
you will discover that topography of their own country,
and descriptions of the beautiful city <i>Praha</i>&mdash;as they
call Prague&mdash;are favourite subjects with the Czechs.</p>

<p>There is no uniformity. Next door to a cabinet-maker's,
whose large-paned window exhibits a variety
of tasteful furniture, you will see a cavern-like grocery
without any window, and the wares all in seeming confusion.
Next, beyond, is a shop resplendent with Bohemian
glass, elegant forms in ruby, gold, and azure,
each one a triumph of art and industry. England is a
generous customer for these fragile articles, as may be
seen any day in some of the best shops in London. Then
comes a sullen-looking front, with grim grated window,
showing no wares, and looking as if it had not cared
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
about customers since the days of King George Podiebrad.
Then a smirking coffee-house, with muslin
curtains and touches of gilding. A little farther, and
there is a great open arch, running far to the rear&mdash;a
beer-house&mdash;the space between the street and the bar
filled with tables bearing brown loaves cut in quarters,
<i>Semmel</i>, and corpulent sausages. Turn which way you
will, you find an endless diversity.</p>

<p>"<i>Glück auf!</i>" writes up a little trader. "<i>Here
are best Coals. Radnitzer Coal.</i>" People who live on
the upper floors hang a small wooden cruciform sign
from their windows by a long string, low enough to
catch the eye and strike the heads of those walking beneath;
and on these dangling crosses, when they are not
spinning round in the wind, you may read that a Dentist,
Shoemaker, or Teacher aloft in his garret would be
happy to supply your wants on reasonable terms.</p>

<p>Judging from the number of queer-looking names
over the doors, Prague must be the head-quarters of
the Czechs, and yet one meets comparatively few examples
of the fine intellectual brow and handsome
features of which I had seen noble specimens in the
villages. Most of the faces struck me as of a very
common cast; and as for the gentle sex, never have I
seen so many ugly women as in Prague. Those of the
working classes are very dowdies, not to say slatterns, in
many cases; and the rows of market-women squatting
by their baskets resemble so many feather-beds tied
round the middle, in a flimsy cotton dress, and crowned
by a red or yellow kerchief pinned under the chin.
Even among the graceful and gaily-dressed ladies I saw
but very few pretty faces. Perhaps I expected too much,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
or it might be, as I was told, that all the pretty women
had gone away to the watering-places!</p>

<p>Surprising to a stranger is the number of soldiers,
sauntering among the other pedestrians, in uniforms
blue, green, gray, or white; or marching in short files
at a brisk pace behind a corporal. Not once did I take
a walk in Prague without seeing three or four of these
little troops stepping out towards one or other quarter
of the compass. What is there to be kept down that
can need such an imposing force? At all events, it
heightens the picturesque effect of the streets.</p>

<p>Stand for half an hour on the bridge and you will
see, while noting that scarcely any besides boys and
priests take off their hats to St. John of the five stars,
how great is the proportion which the army and the
church bear to the rest of the inhabitants. At times
the black and the coloured uniforms appear to have the
best of it. All besides may be divided into two classes&mdash;the
well-dressed and the shabby&mdash;for nothing appears
between the two. There are, however, but few of those
very miserable objects such as haunt the streets of large
towns in England.</p>

<p>Now a man hurries past carrying a tall circular basket
filled with piled-up dinners in round dishes; now
another wheeling bundles of coloured glass rods; now
another with a barrow-load of bread, and many a slice
will you see sold for a noonday repast. Then comes a
troop of lawless-looking street-musicians; then beggars
grinding out squeaky music from tinkered organs;
then a girl carrying a coffin, painted black and yellow,
under her arm, which bears a cross on its gabled lid.
And now and then, among all these, your eye is arrested
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
by a singular, wild-looking figure, whom you will think
the strangest of all. He has lank black hair hanging
to his shoulders from under a fluffy, round-crowned,
broad-brimmed hat&mdash;of the fashion still worn by a few
old Quakers in out-of-the-way places. He disdains a
shirt, and wears a tight jacket and hosen of whitey-brown
serge. He goes barefoot, walking with long, stealthy
strides, looking, so you guess, furtively around. On his
shoulder he carries a coil of fine iron wire, and in his
hand a broken red pan or stone pitcher. Wild, however,
and out of place as he looks, he is only a Wallachian
plying his honest calling. He is a <i>Drateñik</i>&mdash;or
<i>Drahtbinder</i> (Wirebinder), as the Germans call it&mdash;going
about to mend broken pans and pitchers by binding
the fractures together with wire; a task which he
performs with neatness and dexterity.</p>

<p>I went to the <i>Polizeidirection</i> to reclaim my passport.
About a dozen persons were waiting. To some who
looked poor and timid the clerk spoke roughly, assuming
beforehand a something "not regular." One might
fancy that his ungracious occupation had told upon his
looks, for he was the ugliest man I ever saw, and, unlike
the women, who gave themselves airs in the streets,
he seemed to be aware of Nature's unkindness towards
him. When my turn came, he asked, "Where are
you going?"</p>

<p>"To the <i>Riesengebirge</i>."</p>

<p>"<i>So!</i> But we can't sign a passport for the mountains.
You must tell us the name of some town."</p>

<p>"Make it Landeshut, if you will; or any frontier
town in Silesia."</p>

<p>"Can't do that. We must have some town on this
side the mountains."
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't yet know which of three routes I shall take.
Say some town nearest to the mountains. Does it make
any difference?"</p>

<p>"<i>Schön!</i> You can come back here when your mind
is made up." And with this rejoinder, Ugly turned
away to consider a timid lady's request for permission to
go a journey of fifteen miles.</p>

<p>There was time enough, so I strolled away to the
suspension-bridge&mdash;<i>Kaiser Franzens Brücke</i>&mdash;which,
more than 1400 feet long, crosses the Moldau and the
<i>Schützen Insel</i>, a short distance above the stone bridge.
The view midway will make you linger. On the right
bank, <i>Franzens-quai</i>, stretching from one bridge to the
other, forms a spacious esplanade, in the centre of which,
surrounded by gardens, rises the monument erected by
the Estates of Bohemia to the honour of Francis I.
Beyond and on either side the towers and palaces are
seen in a new aspect, differently grouped from our early
morning view. Those of the <i>Kleinseite</i>, backed by the
leafy slopes of the <i>Laurenzberg</i>, while immediately beneath
your eye rests on the green sward and shady
groves of three or four islands. The river rushing past
to the dam makes a lively ripple, imparting a sense of
coolness enjoyed by the visitors who throng the islands
during the summer season. The <i>Sophien Insel</i>, named
after the Archduchess Sophie, the emperor's mother,
with its pleasure-grounds, dancing-floors, orchestras, refreshment-rooms,
and baths, is the chief resort, especially
on Sundays. The large ball-room was the scene
of noisy public meetings in '48; the Sclave Congress
was held there, followed by a Sclavonic costume ball.
These islands are a pleasing feature in the view, and,
with their shady bowers and the noise of the water
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
mingling with strains of music, contrast agreeably with
the matter-of-fact of the city. The <i>Schützen Insel</i> is resorted
to by rifle companies, and you may hear a brisk
succession of shots from the practice that appears to be
always going on.</p>

<p>During the outbreak of June, 1848, the floor of the
bridge was taken up, and the passage across completely
interrupted for some weeks by the military. And it
was to Prince Windischgratz's demonstrations during
the same month that the inhabitants were indebted for
an extension of their handsome quay. An old water-tower,
and sundry ricketty wooden mills that stood at
the end of the stone bridge, were set on fire by a shell
from the prince's artillery, and the space cleared by the
flames was taken into the newly-formed area.</p>

<p>Passing from the bridge through the <i>Aujezder Thor</i>,
you come to the pleasant slopes and gardens of the
<i>Laurenzberg</i>, a hill that overlooks the city and country
around. Winding paths agreeably shaded lead upwards,
until you are stopped on the summit by massive
fortifications; the great "Bread-wall," or "Hunger-wall"&mdash;for
it is known by both names&mdash;which Karl IV.
built all round the city five hundred years ago to give
work to the citizens in a season of distress. From a
buttress which projects clear of the trees, that cover all
the hill-side with a broad mass of foliage, you have a
wide prospect. Greater part of the city from the Jews'
quarter to the Wissehrad lies beneath the eye as a
panorama. The Moldau&mdash;breaking from between low
hills, with here and there a <i>Kahn</i> floating, or a long,
narrow raft drifting to the gap in the dam&mdash;flows past
in a grand curve between towers and palaces, wretched
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
hovels and stately churches, and onwards round the hills
below to join the Elbe. The islands are open as a
map, and you see the puffs of smoke from the rifles
on the <i>Schützen Insel</i>. It is a striking but disappointing
view, for notwithstanding the ancient gables
and various towers that shoot aloft, the city has somewhat
the aspect of a collection of factories, so monotonous
are the long lines of white, many-windowed
wall, bearing their long slopes of bright red roof.
Street after street stretching away, all of the same character,
and scattering on the outskirts into a tame
country, cruelly disappoint your expectations of the
picturesque. Here and there are large patches of green
among houses, and rows of poplars shooting up. Yet,
after all, there is something in the view which makes
you linger. In some of its architectural forms and
features it partly realizes your mental pictures of the
East, and your imagination flies back to the remote
days when the Czechs left their far-away home towards
the sunrise, and wandered on till their leader, looking
down from the hills on the valley of the Moldau, determined
that here should be the seat of his empire. I sat
for an hour on the rough coping of the buttress looking
down on the scene, while the leaves rustled cheerfully
in a cooling breeze, and the sunbeams glistened and
flashed from a thousand windows, and gilded weathercocks,
and the lively ripples of the muddy stream.</p>

<p>If inclined for a quiet stroll, you may wander among
the trees and rocks on the crown of the hill, or visit the
church of St. Lawrence, from whom the hill takes its
name. From the highest summit, in very favourable
weather, it is possible to see <i>St. Georgsberg</i>, near
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
Raudnitz, and peaks of the <i>Mittelgebirge</i> and <i>Riesengebirge</i>&mdash;mountains
on the Saxon and Silesian frontier.</p>

<p>On coming down from the hill, I prowled for
awhile about the <i>Kleinseite</i>, where, besides the antiquities
and rare old palaces, you are struck by the number
of schools and institutions for education. Strange
groupings indeed in this quarter of the city! Palaces
as rich in treasures of art and literature as in historical
associations, side by side with miserable hovels and
narrow, crooked streets, where poverty lurks in rags
and squalor. Little bits of architecture, that are a
delight to look on, catch your eye in unexpected places,
peering out in some instances from among things that
delight not the eye. But the schools are close by, and
innovation creeps slowly on though few perceive it.</p>

<p>You may mount to the Hradschin by some of these
byeways, where you will see how many windows have
inner gratings, and how here and there the prison-like
aspect is relieved by plants and flowers that screen the
iron bars; and by these signs may you know where
honest poverty dwells. In the <i>Hohler Weg</i> and <i>Neue
Welt</i> you have specimens of the Rookery of Prague.
At length, after many ins and outs and bits of steep
stair, you find yourself on the terrace in front of the
Hradschin, and you will be tempted to pause on the
steps and survey the view across the house-tops.</p>

<p>The mass of buildings here is large enough, and shelters
inhabitants enough to form a town. It includes a
royal fortress&mdash;the archbishop's residence&mdash;a nunnery
and monastery, a penal reformatory, besides lodgings of
the official functionaries.</p>

<p>A considerable portion of the huge pile is now used
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">127</a></span>
as barracks for infantry and cavalry, and things military
abound within its courts. There are sentries on duty,
and soldiers off duty lounging about the guard-house,
while their muskets lean against a rail painted black and
yellow. But you pass unchallenged, and while crossing
the quadrangle may see the word SALVE in large
characters in the pavement.</p>

<p>In the third court you come to the cathedral, an unfinished
edifice dedicated to St. Vitus, still showing
marks of Hussite mischief, and of the Great Frederick's
cannon-balls. It covers the site of a church built in
930 in honour of the same saint by Wenzel the Holy&mdash;he
who planted the first vineyard in Bohemia, on the
eastern slope of the Hradschin hill. The foundation-stone
of the present structure was laid by Charles IV.,
during the lifetime of his father John; and although
the building went on for forty-two years, it was never
completed. In 1673 Leopold I. made an attempt
to finish it according to the original plan; but he did
nothing more than build a few columns in different
styles, which stood in the fore-court until 1842, when
they were pulled down, as the beginning of a new effort
for completing the structure. Stimulated by the zeal of
Canon Pesina, a Prague Cathedral Building Union was
founded, with Count Francis Thun for chief; and preparations
were made for the work, and for raising a
million florins to pay for it, when the troubles of 1848&mdash;fatal
to so many hopes and noble purposes&mdash;put a
stop to the proceedings.</p>

<p>If the outside disappoint you by sundry additions and
contradictory ornaments, which spoil the pure effect of
the original Gothic, you will find cause enough for
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
astonishment inside. At the western end of the nave
stands the richly-carved mausoleum, erected in 1589 by
Kollin of Nuremberg, at the cost of Rudolf II. It is of
Carrara marble, and in magnitude and beauty of sculpture
may well vie with Maximilian's tomb in the Court
Church at Innsbruck. Royal dust is plentiful in the
vault beneath, for therein lie, besides Rudolf himself,
Charles IV. and his four wives, Wenzel IV., Ladislaus
Posthumus, George von Podiebrad, Ferdinand I. and
his wife Anna, Maximilian II., and the Archduchess
Maria Amelia, who was buried in 1804. From admiring
the manifold carvings, which show the touch of
the true artist, you will perhaps look next at the tomb
of St. John Nepomuk, on the right near the altar.
Surely no other saint, or living bishop, even in this age
of testimonials, ever had such a service of plate presented
to him as that! It is a small mountain of silver. On
high, silver angels hold a canopy over a silver shrine,
which, borne aloft by angels, life size, contains the
martyr's body in a crystal coffin, set off by shining
statues, glittering ornaments, bas-reliefs, and tall candlesticks,
all alike made of silver. If current testimony
may be relied on, there are nearly two tons of the precious
metal therein dedicated to the holy Johannes. No
wonder that you see the saint's statue on so many
bridges in Bohemia, and even for a few miles beyond
the frontiers.</p>

<p>The curiosities of the church are more than can be
examined in a brief visit. There are twelve chapels
ranged about the nave&mdash;the last fitted up as an oratory
for the Imperial family. In one of them you may see
the foot of a candlestick, which, according to tradition,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
was one of those made for Solomon's Temple, from
whence it was conveyed to Rome, and afterwards to
Milan, where Wladislaus I. seized the precious relic, and
he brought it to Prague. At all events, the workmanship
shows signs of great antiquity. And near the western
end there hangs a "true image"&mdash;a head of Christ, the
holy placid features showing a trace of sadness, the eyes
looking at you with an earnest, though pitying expression.
It is a remarkable specimen of early art; much
venerated by the devout, who would soon obliterate it
by kisses were it not protected by glass. A moustachioed
man came up, and, taking off his hat, pressed
his lips upon the sacred mouth while I was still looking
at the painting.</p>

<p>Frescoes bordered by gems adorn the walls of St.
Wenzel's chapel; and here are preserved the saint's
helmet and coat of mail, a brass ring to which he clung
when he fell murdered by his brother's hand, and other
relics. Here also the Bohemian regalia are kept in
rigorous security under seven locks: St. Wenzel's sword
is among them, and with this, after his coronation, the
monarch creates knights of St. Wenzel's order.</p>

<p>The verger gives you his cut-and-dry description;
but, as he may omit to tell you a little bit of history, it
would be well to remember that in this chapel the Archduke
Ferdinand was chosen King of Bohemia in 1526,
whereby the kingdom has ever since belonged to the
house of Hapsburg.</p>

<p>Further concerning statues, lamps, tombs, and paintings,
and the organ, with its 2831 pipes, the treasure-chamber,
where, among other things, are sixteen leaves
of St. Mark's Gospel in the hand of the Evangelist&mdash;the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
rest said to be at Venice&mdash;the trinary chapel, and the
seven bells in the tower, among which "Big Sigmund"
weighs thirteen tons, and the octagon chapel, and the
pulpit in the fore-court, may be read in guide-books.</p>

<p>Go next to the <i>Loretto Platz</i>, and look at the palace
which once belonged to Count Czernin, and at the
Loretto chapel&mdash;an exact copy of the far-famed Holy
House in Popedom. Or perhaps you will take more
interest in remembering that in a house near this chapel
Tycho Brahe made the observations from which he and
Kepler produced the <i>Tabulæ Rudolphinæ</i>&mdash;a work well
known to astronomers; perpetuating in its title the name
of their munificent patron.</p>

<p>As old engravings testify, the Hradschin once looked
picturesque when its twenty-two high-roofed towers
were all standing. Of these only four remain; and in
the Black Tower you may see fearsome specimens of
mediæval dungeons. If those grim walls could speak,
the fate would be known of some of Bohemia's worthiest,
who, within a year after the battle of the White Hill,
suddenly disappeared from among their families and
friends, and were never more heard of.</p>

<p>You may end your exploration by crossing to the
opposite side of the hill, and taking a view of the great
range of buildings from the <i>Staubbrücke</i>, which crosses
the <i>Hirschgraben</i>, and commands a prospect over the
north-western environs of the city, and of the contrasts
between the palace on the hill-top and the frowsy
haunts at the foot.

<h2>CHAPTER XII.</h2>

<p class="hanging">
The Tandelmarkt&mdash;Old Men and Boys at Rag Fair&mdash;Jews in Prague&mdash;The
Judenstadt&mdash;Schools and Synagogues&mdash;Remote Antiquity&mdash;Ducal
Victims&mdash;Jewish Bravery&mdash;Removal of Boundary Wires.
</p>

<p class="p2">From the Hradschin, with its imperial associations,
living and dead, to an Old Clothes Market, is a change
over which you may laugh or lament, according to
your mood. If you have seen Rag Fair in London,
you can form a weak notion of what I saw in the <i>Tandelmarkt</i>
at Prague on my return to the <i>Altstadt</i> from
the palatial hill. For, besides the difference of architecture,
which heightens the general effect, foreign
Jews, whether in consequence of shabbier clothes or
dirtier habits, have always a more picturesque appearance
than their brethren in England.</p>

<p>What a gabble! accompanied by gesticulations so
violent that you would think the traders were coming
to blows. Old men bent by age, of venerable aspect
and beard patriarchal, stand chaffering as eagerly for
cast-off garments as if they had Methuselah's years
before them in which to enjoy the proceeds. "It is
naught," argues the buyer; and the graybeards whine
over their frippery, and turn it about, and display it to
the best advantage, and reply in a tone that extorts at
last the reluctant coins from the customer's pocket.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span></p>

<p>Look at the boys! How they ply nimbly hither and
thither, picking up stray bargains: adepts already in
the craft of their grandsires. Look at their fathers!
No whining in their traffic: but hard altercation, in
which patient subterfuge proves more than a match for
vehemence. Here and there, however, a cunning
Czech, by sharp practice with his tongue, and a timely
exhibition of his money, succeeds in carrying off a
blouse or hosen on his own terms; and the Hebrew,
while pouching the coins, sends after him low mutterings,
which forebode ill to the next customer.</p>

<p>As you wander among the stalls, and push between
the busy groups, noting how much of the merchandise
appears utterly worthless, you will find cause enough
for laughter and for lamentation.</p>

<p>According to the census of 1850, the number of
Jews in Prague is about nine thousand, of whom nearly
eight thousand are natives. Besides these, there are
many resident in some of the neighbouring villages;
but the number is less now than formerly. Daily perambulations
of the city with the old, familiar, dingy
bag on shoulder, in quest of "clo," and the trade of the
<i>Tandelmarkt</i>, are the resources to which most betake
themselves.</p>

<p>The place assigned for their residence, known as the
<i>Judenstadt</i> (altered of late years to <i>Josefstadt</i>), is a few
acres of the <i>Altstadt</i>, lying between the <i>Grosser Ring</i>
and the river: by far the most densely populated part
of Prague. It is crowded with houses: traversed by
narrow streets not remarkable for cleanliness, and has
altogether an uninviting aspect. Your sanitary reformer
would here find a strong case of overcrowding: two or
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
three families in one room, and a dozen, and, in some
instances, more than twenty owners for a single house.
The number of faces of men, women, and children at
the windows, and the many comers and goers along the
devious ways and in and out of the darksome passages,
leave you no reason to doubt the fact. And in these
miserable tenements dwell some of the chiefest men of
the community&mdash;men appointed to places of trust and
honour, who sit in the old Jewish council-house, and
officiate in the synagogue.</p>

<p>But even here the ancient complexion and character
are changing. New and commodious houses built in a
few places are a standing reproach to the rest of the
neighbourhood, and to the partisans of dirt. And while
prying about you will hear the voices of children in
sundry schools, where the teachers talk and work as if
they were in earnest. Nor is spiritual culture neglected,
for you will see some four or five synagogues, and a
<i>Temple of the Reformed Israelitish God's-worship</i>.</p>

<p>In Prague, the manners and customs of the Jews are
said to retain more of their primeval characteristics than
in any other place out of Asia; the chief cause being the
bitter persecutions to which the race, as everywhere
else, were subjected. Some accounts assign their first
settlement here to the fabulous ages of history, and
make it seventy-two years earlier than that of the
Czechs, or in the year 462 of the present era. And the
tradition runs, that on the ground now occupied by the
<i>Judenstadt</i>, and on part of the <i>Kleinseite</i>, the first buildings
were erected.</p>

<p>In the early days the Jews lived in whatever quarter
of the city suited them best; but, in consequence of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
many corrupt practices, Duke Spitignew II. banished
them all from Bohemia in 1059. Eight years later,
Duke Wratislaw II., moved to pity, granted leave for
their return, though not on compassionate conditions.
Besides doubling their former amount of yearly tax,
they were to pay an annual fine of two hundred silver
marks, to purchase twelve houses near the river in the
<i>Kleinseite</i> for their residence, and to wear a yellow
cloak as a distinguishing garment. Their number was
never to exceed one thousand; but in a few years it had
grown to five thousand, whereupon the surplus were
banished; and, to check smuggling among the remainder,
they were removed from the <i>Kleinseite</i> to their
present quarters.</p>

<p>The yellow cloak having fallen into disuse, Ferdinand
II. revived the regulation with sharp severity in
1561. From the Second Ferdinand (in 1627) the
Jews obtained important privileges, in consideration of
a yearly gift of forty thousand gulden: liberty to choose
their own magistrates and judges, to establish schools,
and multiply in numbers without limit. In 1648 they
took a valiant part in the defence of Prague against the
Swedes, and the banner won by their bravery is still
preserved in the old synagogue. In 1745 they were
once more banished, but had permission to return the
following year. Joseph II. placed them on an equality
with other citizens, and allowed them to buy land, and
dress as they pleased.</p>

<p>In the good old times, whenever any turbulence occurred
in Prague, it was always made the excuse for
plundering or persecution of the Jews; and in this particular
their history accords with that of their brethren
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
in all other cities of Europe. They did but barely
escape in the memorable '48. Their town once had
nine gates, which were shut at nightfall; and subsequently,
wires stretched across the streets, marked the
boundary between Hebrew and Christian: these were
removed in the year last mentioned, and have not since
been replaced.

<h2>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>

<p class="hanging">
The Jewish Sabbath&mdash;The Old Synagogue&mdash;Traditions concerning it&mdash;The
Gloomy Interior&mdash;The Priests&mdash;The Worshippers and the Worship&mdash;The
Talkers&mdash;The Book of the Law&mdash;The Rabbi&mdash;The Startling
Gun&mdash;A Birth at Vienna&mdash;Departed Glory.
</p>

<p class="p2">My second day in Prague being a Saturday, I went
to see the Jews at worship in their synagogue. The
<i>Josefstadt</i> was comparatively quiet; but few persons in
the streets, and those dressed in their best; the boys
carrying prayer-books, and the men with what looked
like an apron rolled up under their arm. On entering
the synagogue, I found that the apron was a white
scarf (<i>talis</i>), with blue striped ends, which each man
put on across his shoulders before taking his seat.</p>

<p>But first, a few words about the building itself. On
approaching it along the narrow <i>Beleles-gasse</i>, you are
struck at once by its appearance of great antiquity&mdash;visibly
the most ancient among buildings decrepit with
age. It is sunk low in the ground, down a flight of
some ten or twelve steps, as if the first builders, worshipping
in fear, had sought concealment. Of architectural
display there is none. Walls blackened by the
dust and storms of centuries, with two or three narrow-pointed
windows, looking so much more like a bride-well
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
than a temple of the living God, that not till I had
seen the steady procession of men and boys to the door
could I believe it to be really the synagogue.</p>

<p>No wonder that its foundation is referred back to
days ere Europe had a history. One tradition says,
that no sooner was the Temple at Jerusalem destroyed,
than angels immediately set about building this synagogue
on the bank of the Moldau. According to
another, certain people digging in a hill which once
covered the spot, came upon a portion of a wall, and,
continuing their excavation, cleared away the hill, and
found a synagogue built already to their hands. And,
as before mentioned, there is the tradition which dates
it seventy-two years earlier than the arrival of the
Czechs.</p>

<p>It was a remarkable sight that met my eyes as I
descended into the building. If the outside conveys
an impression of extreme age, much more does the
inside. The deep-sunk floor, the dim light, the walls
and ceiling as black as age and smoke can make them,
are the features of a dungeon rather than of a place of
thanksgiving. The height, owing to the low level of
the floor, appears to be greater than the length, and,
looking up, you can easily believe that cleansing has
never been attempted since the first prayer was offered.
Old-fashioned brass chandeliers hang from the ceiling,
and here and there a brazen shield on the wall. The
<i>almemmar</i>, or rostrum, occupies the centre of the floor,
and in the narrow space on either side and at one
end are the seats and stools for the congregation, with
numerous reading-stands crowded between. These
stands have a shabby, makeshift look, no two being
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
alike in height or pattern, as if each man had constructed
his own. Hence a general look of disorder as
well as of dinginess.</p>

<p>The doorkeeper requested me to keep my cap on;
and I saw that all present sat covered. Even the
officiating priests wore their hats, and in dress and
appearance were in no way different from the hearers.
Every man had his <i>talis</i> on, and was continually
fidgetting and shrugging to keep it on his shoulders,
and his Hebrew prayer-book from slipping off
the stand. The priests walked restlessly up and down
the <i>almemmar</i>, but whether they were praying or exhorting
I could not tell, for all sounded alike to me&mdash;a
glib and noisy gabble. And all the while the
men on the darksome seats under the gallery kept up a
murmur of talk in twos and threes, in a way that
sounded very much like a discussion of questions left
unfinished on the <i>Tandelmarkt</i>. Now and then a "Hush!
Hush!" was impatiently ejaculated by one of the devout
who sat near with eyes fixed on his book; but the back
seats took no heed, and, though in the temple, ceased
not to talk of merchandise. Very few were they who
maintained a fixed attention; a ceaseless rocking of the
body to and fro, as, with half-closed eyes, they went
through their recitations, distinguished them from the
rest.</p>

<p>Now and then the priests paused in their uneasy
walk, drew together, and had a little bit of quiet talk
among themselves, seasoned by a pinch of snuff all
round. Then they separated, and one, pacing from side
to side, gave repeated utterance to a short phrase, in a
wailing, sing-song tone, while the others went behind the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
veil, and presently came forth again, one bearing what
at first sight looked like a thick double roll surmounted
by two silver candlesticks. It was the Book of the
Law; and no sooner did the bearers appear than a cry
of joy was set up by the whole assembly. A shabby
wrapper and the silver ornaments were taken off, and
then the sacred parchment was seen wound on two
cylinders, so that as a portion was read from one it
might be rolled up on the other.</p>

<p>The scroll was laid on the table with some formal
ceremony, and the priests, unrolling a part, began to
read, but in such a snuffling tone and careless manner
as indicated but little reverence. After each one had
snuffled in turn, the old rabbi, wearing a long gown
and fur cap, was assisted on to the <i>almemmar</i>, and,
bending low over the scroll, he read a few passages
solemnly and impressively, though in a voice weak
and tremulous with age: audible to all, for the talkers
under the gallery held their peace. His task finished,
he was led back to his seat: the roll was wound up, and,
with the wrapper and ornaments replaced, was returned
to its place behind the veil.</p>

<p>The monotonous murmur was renewed: one of the
priests commenced a recitation, but he had scarcely
opened his lips than the report of a cannon boomed
loudly from the Hradschin, startling all within hearing,
and making the streets echo again.</p>

<p>"Ah!" cried the talkers, "that's for the empress. Is
it prince or princess this time?"</p>

<p>The priest halted in his recitation as the thunderous
shocks succeeded&mdash;one, two, three, and so on, up to
twenty-five&mdash;when, after another pause of listening
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
expectation, "Ah!" cried the talkers again, "'tis only
a princess;" and they took up once more the thread of
their murmur.</p>

<p>Then followed more gabbling and snuffling from the
rostrum; and, as I listened and looked round from face
to face, noting the expression, something like sadness
came over me; for were not those slovenly utterances a
hopeless lamentation over the glory that had departed?
Was it clean gone for ever? Did no trace remain of
that solemn and gorgeous ceremonial, instituted when
the glory came down and filled the house in the
presence of the king, and of the Levites and singers
"arrayed in white linen, having cymbals, and psalteries,
and harps;" and of the people? When the king prayed,
"Now therefore arise, O Lord God, into Thy resting-place,
Thou, and the ark of Thy strength: let Thy
priests, O Lord God, be clothed with salvation, and
let Thy saints rejoice in goodness."</p>

<p>An hour passed, and still the recitations and murmur
went on. I had seen enough, and thought, as I stepped
forth into the daylight, that the cry, "His blood be on
us, and on our children!" had been fearfully avenged.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XIV.</h2>

<p class="hanging">
The Alte Friedhof&mdash;A Stride into the Past&mdash;The Old Tombs&mdash;Vegetation
and Death&mdash;Haunted Graves&mdash;Ancient Epitaph&mdash;Rabbi Löw&mdash;His
Scholars&mdash;Symbols of the Tribes&mdash;The Infant's Coffin&mdash;The Playground&mdash;From
Death to Life.
</p>

<p class="p2">The old synagogue and old Jewish burial-ground
(<i>Alte Friedhof</i>) are but a few yards apart. On my
way from one to the other I passed sundry groups,
chiefly women, talking with animation about the interesting
event signalized from the Hradschin. And
more than one expressed a wish that a prince and not
a princess had been born to the House of Hapsburg.</p>

<p>The angle of a wall, overtopped within by foliage,
marks the site of the burial-ground. The doorkeeper
unlocked the gate, and, passing in, I felt as if, instead of
merely stepping across a threshold, a long stride had
been taken back into the Past. The living world is all
shut out, and you are alone with the dead&mdash;the dead of
long ago.</p>

<p><i>Beth Chaim</i>, or the House of Life, is the name in
Hebrew; but there is no life save that of gnarly elder-trees,
gooseberry-bushes, and creeping weeds that struggle
up into a wild maze from among the overcrowded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
tombs and gravestones. The stones, thick and massive,
are so incredibly numerous, that they are wedged
and jammed together in most extraordinary confusion.
Some lean on one side; some forwards, some backwards,
and many would fall outright were they not
propped up by others standing near. Hence all sorts of
curious holes and corners, in which grow choking weeds
and coarse grass, hiding the inscriptions, and producing
a strange impression of neglect and decay.</p>

<p>With this impression comes a sense of the mysterious,
heightened by the nature of the ground, which, irregular
in outline and very uneven, confines your view to but a
small portion at once. Though the enclosure takes up
about one-twelfth of the <i>Judenstadt</i>, your idea becomes
one of a succession of patches of tangled foliage drooping
over mouldering tombs. Now the path mounts a
broken slope; now dips into a narrow way between the
walls of encroaching streets and houses; now enters a
widening area, where the fragrant blossoms and branches
of the elders droop gracefully over the ancient memorials&mdash;or
comes to an end in some out-of-the-way nook.
Thus you are led on pace by pace, always wondering
what will appear at the next turn.</p>

<p>And there is something mysterious in the associations
of the place. Tales are told of ghosts that haunt the
tombs; unhappy spirits bringing terror and doom to
the living, or goblins playing gruesome tricks. And
again in its antiquity: anticipating by a hundred years
the building of Prague, as proved by a date on a tombstone.
No wonder that the ground is heaped high, and
full of ups and downs! Thousands of Jews have turned
to dust beneath the surface.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span></p>

<p>Something, however, must be deducted from its
antiquity. If, as careful investigation gives reason to
believe, the old synagogue was built in the thirteenth
century, we may suppose the opening of the burial-ground
to have taken place within the same period.
The notion arose from misreading the stone, whereby
one thousand was subtracted from the date. The inscriptions
are in the Hebrew character, and, for the most
part, deeply cut. The stone in question is inscribed:</p>

<p><i>In Elul</i> (August) <i>the 22nd day: lamentation ...
was the ornament of our head snatched away</i>. <i>Sara,
whose memory stands in high praise, wife of Joseph
Katz, died. She was modest; and reached out her hand
to the poor. Her speech was mild and agreeable, without
shame or vice. Her desire was after the house of the
Creator. She gave herself up to whatsoever is holy, and
continued steadfast. She trained up her children according
to the law of God.</i></p>

<p>One of the most remarkable tombs is that of Rabbi
Löw (or Lyon)&mdash;a handsome temple-formed sarcophagus,
distinguished by a sculptured lion, and the beauty
of its workmanship. The rabbi himself was a remarkable
man in his day; eminent for nobleness of mind
and great learning; and it is recorded of him that he
was honoured by a visit from the Emperor Rudolf II.
in his own house. He lies here in good company; for
on both sides of his tomb extends a row of gravestones,
thirty-three in number, marking the resting-place of
thirty-three of his favourite scholars; and not far off a
taller stone shows the grave of his son-in-law.</p>

<p>On many of the slabs you will see curious devices
deeply cut, and figures resembling a coat-of-arms. These
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
indicate the tribe, or family or name of the deceased.
There lies one of the house of Aaron, as shown by the
two hands; a pitcher denotes the tribe of Levi; and
Israel is signified by a bunch of grapes. The name
<i>Fischeles</i> or <i>Karpeles</i> is symbolised by a fish; Lyon by
the royal quadruped; and <i>Hahn</i> by a domestic fowl;
and so forth.</p>

<p>All these and many other noteworthy objects will
you see while wandering about this mortal wilderness;
and the doorkeeper, if in the mood, will tell you many a
legend, and point out the tombs of Simeon the Just, and
Anna Schmiedes, concerning whom something might
be said should the humour serve. No burials have been
permitted since the reign of Joseph II.; and from that
date, except that the path is clean, the whole place
appears to have been abandoned to the influence of the
seasons. Many of the stones are broken; here and
there the slabs of the tombs are crumbled away, leaving
large holes through which you may look and see green
stains and patches of dark mould. In a dry spot at the
foot of a wall I saw a bundle nailed up within rough
staves of fir; it was a still-born infant in its coffin; and
perhaps for such a little hole may still be dug in the
ancient ground.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding that the backs of a few old houses
look down on the graves, they fit in with the scene,
and your impression of deep loneliness remains undisturbed,
except in one corner, where the surface is clear
and level. It is used at times as a playground for the
children, whose voices you hear from the open windows
of the schoolroom that encloses one side. Painter and
poet might alike make a picture of childhood, full of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
mirth and happiness, playing in the sunshine; and in
the background, all too near, the haunted tombs of
their forefathers.</p>

<p>A few years ago the Jews, finding their quarter much
too small for commodious or decent habitation, petitioned
the authorities for leave to widen their boundaries,
and in answer were recommended to destroy their
venerable <i>Friedhof</i>, and build houses upon the ground.
No willingness has yet been manifested to adopt the
recommendation.</p>

<p>As on entering, so on departing, are you aware of a
strange impression; from the field of death, from silence
and solitude, you pass at once to the noisy life of the
streets, and the spell wrought upon you by the brief
saunter where sits</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"The Shadow cloak'd from head to foot</p>
<p>Who keeps the keys of all the creeds,"</p>
</div></div>

<p>is broken with a shock. And by-and-by, when in the
noisier thoroughfares, vague fancies will come to you of
having had a sepulchral dream.

</p>

<p class="p2">The <i>Kolowratstrasse</i> is one of the finest streets in
Prague. It is broad, straight, and well paved; contains
the best hotels, the most elegant coffee-houses, the
handsomest shops, and a palace or two. It was always
known as the <i>Graben</i>; for here once flowed the ditch
separating the <i>Alt</i> and <i>Neustadt</i>, and <i>Graben</i> it still
remains, the folkname prevailing over that of the Imperial
minister after whom it was named some twenty
years ago.</p>

<p>One of the palaces formerly belonged to Wallenstein's
opponent, Count Octavio Picolomini; the other now
contains the Bohemian Museum, which, an honour to
the city, is a praiseworthy example of the intellectual
movement among the natives. The Museum Company,
formed in 1818, to collect works of art, natural productions
of the country, curiosities, and antiquities, appointed
a committee in 1830 to promote a scientific cultivation
of the Czechish language and literature, and to
create a section of archæology and natural history.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
Under the designation <i>Matice ceská</i> (Bohemian Mother),
a fund was established and vigorously maintained, out
of which the desired objects were accomplished; particularly
as regards the literature. To call Palacky into
activity&mdash;a historian of whom Bohemia is justly proud&mdash;was
no trifling achievement. Up to 1847 the collections
were kept in the Sternberg Palace at the
Hradschin; but in that year they were removed to their
present more convenient and accessible quarters.</p>

<p>Later in the day I went to the Museum: I wished to
see with what sort of carnal weapons the Hussites had
gained so many victories over their fellow-countrymen.
First you enter the department of geology and mineralogy,
the richest and most important of the whole collection.
The specimens are well arranged, and among
them you may see minerals and fossils which give a
special interest to the geology of Bohemia.</p>

<p>Concerning these fossils, the late Dean of Westminster
says, in his <i>Bridgewater Treatise</i>: "The
finest example of vegetable remains I have ever witnessed,
is that of the coal mines of Bohemia. The
most elaborate imitations of living foliage upon the
painted ceilings of Italian palaces bear no comparison
with the beauteous profusion of extinct vegetable forms
with which the galleries of these instructive coal-mines
are overhung. The roof is covered as with a canopy
of gorgeous tapestry, enriched with festoons of most
graceful foliage, flung in wild, irregular profusion over
every portion of its surface. The effect is heightened
by the contrast of the coal-black colour of these vegetables
with the light groundwork of the rock to which
they are attached. The spectator feels himself transported,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
as if by enchantment, into the forests of another
world; he beholds trees of forms and characters now
unknown upon the surface of the earth, presented to his
senses almost in the beauty and vigour of their primeval
life; their scaly stems and bending branches, with their
delicate apparatus of foliage, are all spread before him,
little impaired by the lapse of countless ages, and bearing
faithful records of extinct systems of vegetation,
which began and terminated in times of which these
relics are the infallible historians."</p>

<p>If you care but little for botany and zoology, with
plants, fossils, and creatures from before the Flood, the
attendant will lead you at once to the archæological
department, and uncover the glass-cases containing rare
old manuscripts. Among them are a poem of the ninth
century about Libussa, a somewhat mythical Queen of
Bohemia, from whom Palacky has cleared away the
fable; the <i>Niebelungenlied</i> in Czechish; a Latin
Lexicon with Bohemian gloss, date 1102; seven editions
of the Bible in Czechish, all translated before
Luther's, show how the Bohemians profited by the reading
of Wycliffe's books which were sent to them from
England; and a remarkable hymn-book, written at the
cost of different guilds, each of whom ornamented their
portion with exquisite paintings in miniature; specimens
of the earliest representations of musical notes; and
the first book printed in Bohemia, <i>Historia Trojanska</i>,
1468.</p>

<p>You will look with interest at the letters by Huss,
and the challenge which he hung up on the gate of the
University, declaring his religious opinions, and his
readiness to maintain them by argument against all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
comers: Latin documents, in a stiff, formal hand.
Equally stiff is a letter written by Ziska, dated from the
Hussite camp at Tabor; but there is a world of suggestion
in those hard characters. That rusty leaf sets
your memory recalling the events of five hundred years
ago: the journey of Huss to face the wicked Council,
and martyrdom at Constance, under a safe-conduct
granted by the Emperor Sigismund, requiring all men
to let the valiant preacher go and come, and tarry freely
and unharmed;&mdash;the furious outbreak of the Protestants
at the accursed condemnation of their teacher to the
flames;&mdash;their sanguinary battles, and fiery zeal, and
avowed determination to root out their enemies, whereby
for eighteen years the land was laid waste with fire and
sword, and the name of Hussite became a very terror:&mdash;and
their redoubtable leader, Ziska the one-eyed, standing
out from among them in bold relief, a captain most
resolute and skilful, the instrument of righteous vengeance
upon the execrable Sigismund; who, though he
lost that single flashing eye of his, yet never lost a battle,
nor the confidence of his followers. We see him amidst
his rough and ready fighting men in the camp, on the
heights to which, in the pride of their hearts, they gave
a name from Scripture; and where they quenched their
thirst in the water of Jordan, exulting,</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"What hill is like to Tabor hill in beauty and in fame?"</p>
</div></div>

<p>From the letter you turn to look at a portrait of the
warrior. It is a miserable painting, very much in the
signboard style, yet you can mark the breadth of
shoulder beneath the gleaming corslet, the oval face,
aquiline nose, large bright eye, and lofty forehead, shaded
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
by thick, black, curling hair, and picture to yourself a
proper hero. There is another and a better portrait in
the Strahow monastery, and by noting the best points
of each you will improve your idea, though perhaps not
to full satisfaction. The attendant, moreover, will call
your attention to a portrait of Huss, whose features express
but little of the intellectual qualities and the steadfastness
by which he was characterized.</p>

<p>A few paces farther, and there are the weapons with
which the Hussites fought and won battles in the name
of the Lord. Flails, shields, and firelocks of a very primitive
construction. And such flails! The short swinging
arm is hung by strong iron staples to the end of a stout
staff, about six feet in length, and is braced up in iron
bands, which bristle with projecting points, the better to
make an impression on an enemy's skull. Truly a formidable
weapon! Try the weight. The arm must be
strong that would wield it with effect; and mighty
must have been the motive that sent whole ranks armed
therewith rushing to the onslaught as to a threshing-floor.
Looking at these things, you realize somewhat
of the shock and storm of the events in which they were
employed.</p>

<p>Besides the stacks of weapons, the room contains in
glass-cases round the walls numerous ivory carvings of
singular merit and rarity, and other curiosities with
which you may divert your thoughts. And in a neighbouring
apartment there hangs an engraved view of
Prague as it stood a few years before the fatal day of the
White Hill, well worth inspection. The Hradschin and
Wyssehrad, at opposite ends of the city, look really picturesque
crowned with numerous towers.</p>

<p>Walking afterwards through the markets, and seeing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
the dowdies sitting by their stalls under large red umbrellas,
and the number of shabby men loitering about,
I wondered if they were indeed the descendants of those
who, under Ziska's command, had wielded the flails.
However, in 1848, the men proved that the fighting-blood
still circulated in their veins.</p>

<p>The authorities had lost no time, and on every corner
placards were posted, announcing in loyal terms the
"<i>glückliche Entbindung</i>" of the empress; but though
crowds stopped to read, I saw no manifestations of joy.
Great was the concourse, too, in the <i>Grosser Ring</i>,
where a <i>Te Deum</i> was offered with pomp and ceremony
in presence of the city militia: close ranks of green uniforms
interposed between priests and people.</p>

<p>The letter of the Würzburg professor opened for me
the hospitable doors of a pleasant house on a hill-slope
beyond the city. Father, mother, and the two daughters
joined in showing kindness to one who came to them
with credentials from son and brother. The young
ladies spoke English fluently, and while we sauntered
between odorous flower-beds and under drooping cherry-trees,
they took pleasure in exercising their acquirement.
Then we had tea in a pretty garden-house, all open to
the breeze and quivering sunbeams and rustling vespers
of the leaves. A Bohemian tea&mdash;cutlets, potatoes, salad,
cheese, and butter, bottled beer, <i>Toleranz</i>, and the fragrant
beverage itself poured from a real teapot. <i>Toleranz</i>
was something new to me: it is a pungent, relishing
preparation, in which horseradish is a principal ingredient,
and at your first taste you will think it appropriately
named.</p>

<p>It was while chatting over this delightful repast that
I was told all the pretty women had left Prague for the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
watering-places. Two at least were left behind. The
conversation of the Czechish servants who waited on
us, heard at a short distance, sounded like a screechy
quarrel; and on my remarking that I had noticed similar
discords during a ramble in Wales, one of the young
ladies replied, in explanation, "Our friends often think
we are scolding our servants, when all the while we are
speaking to them in a quiet, natural tone. Your ear is
deceived. There is nothing but good-humour among
them."</p>

<p>It was late each evening when I walked back across
the fields to the city; just the hour, as it seemed, when
the great arched beer-vaults in the <i>Rossmarkt</i> were
in their prime. There was something striking in the
long gas-lit vista viewed from the entrance, every table
crowded with tipplers, dimly seen through tobacco-smoke;
waiters flitting to and fro with tankards; the
damsel at the sausage-stall trying to serve a dozen customers
at once; while high above the rumbling, rattling
din, sounded the liveliest strains of music. I sat for
awhile on an upturned barrel watching the scene. Here
workmen and labourers, and those of lower degree, the
proletaires of Prague, were enjoying their evening&mdash;making
merry after the toils of the day. These were
the folk who would fight whether or no in 1848; whose
bullet-marks are yet to be seen on many of the houses.
Either the beer was strong, or they drank too deeply,
for many staggered into the street, and went reeling
homewards; conquered more hopelessly by their own
hand than by Prince Windischgratz's bombardment.

</p>

<p class="p2">The streets were alive before the lazy hours approached
on Sunday morning. Here and there the walls covered
with handbills, red, blue, green, and yellow, presented a
gay appearance. The Summer Theatre, in which you sit
under the open sky and see plays acted by daylight, was
open&mdash;<i>Jubelfest!</i> ran the announcements: <i>Health and
Prosperity to the House of Hapsburg</i>. Music and a ball
on the Sophia Island&mdash;music on the Shooting Island&mdash;music
at H<i>raba's</i> Railway Garden&mdash;music at the <i>Pstrossischer</i>
Garden&mdash;music at Podol&mdash;music at Wrssowitz&mdash;music
at the <i>Fliedermühle</i>&mdash;a military band at Bubencz&mdash;in
short, music everywhere. And everywhere "<i>Pilsen
beer, in Ice</i>." And so the streets were alive at an early
hour with citizens going to an early mass that longer time
might remain for pleasure, or starting for some of the
neighbouring villages, or for the White Hill, where a
saint's festival was to be celebrated&mdash;all dressed in their
Sunday clothes, and looking as if they had made up
their minds for a holiday.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span></p>

<p>The morning is bright and the breeze playful, and
the sober colours having all chosen to stay at home,
there are none but the gayest tints abroad in the sunshine.
Pink appears to be the favourite. Pink skirts,
pink scarfs, pink ribands, pink bonnets; but no lack of
all besides, and more than make up the rainbow. Not
a work-a-day dowdy to be seen. Here come father,
mother, and half a dozen children, the sire carrying a
basket, and one or two of the youngsters a havresack,
all eager with anticipated pleasure. Here half a dozen
sweethearts going to make a day of it. Here a troop
of lads nimble of foot, noisy in talk, and proud of their
orange and purple decorations in waistcoat and necktie,
while now and then a <i>Fiaker</i> trots past laden with a
party who prefer a holiday on wheels; and always there
come the eternal soldiers, rank and file, or tramping at
liberty.</p>

<p>The spectacle is animated in the spacious area of the
<i>Grosser Ring</i>, where the gay throngs mingle and traverse
from all directions; entering or leaving the <i>Teinkirche</i>,
where service is performed in the Czechish
tongue. Striking is the contrast between them and a
group of sunburnt haymakers squatted in the centre,
men and women in rustic garments, gazing wonderingly
around from amid many-coloured bundles, piles of
scythes, and scattered sickles. They look half amazed
at finding themselves in a great city, and as if fearful of
ever finding their way out again.</p>

<p>All this and much more did I see while on my way
to hear the service in the metropolitan church on the
Hradschin. The steep stair-flights which, avoiding the
narrow, crooked streets, lead directly up to the palace,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
were all a-blaze with shining silks and satins, the
wearers of which were mounting slowly upwards on
dainty feet in the full glare of the hot sun. Already
nearly every seat in the church was filled, and as the
service went on the aisles were thronged, the women on
one side, the men on the other, though with exceptions.
The opportunity was favourable for seeing something of
the better class of citizens, for of such the congregation
appeared chiefly to be. Again I looked for pretty faces
along the variegated aisle, and though there was no
dearth of grace and animation, I was forced to believe
that the beauties had not yet returned from the watering-places.
Meanwhile the service went on; three
robed priests officiated at the altar, the little bell tinkled,
the host was lifted up, every head was bowed, and incense
floated around the cross, while the boys set to
feed the censers pulled one another's hair on the sly,
and played pranks in their corner.</p>

<p>I crept quietly up to the organ-loft when the time
for music was near, and saw seedy men take their post
at the bellows, and in the front seat of the gallery a
row of young men and boys tuning up their fiddles.
The great height prevents the twang and scrape from
being heard below, and affords, moreover, opportunity
for fun, for as they screw and twang they reach across
and tweak ears, or prod a cheek with the end of a bow,
or bend down and tell some joke which well-nigh
chokes them with suppressed laughter. At last the
signal is given, and as if by one impulse they strike
into a symphony, in which the organ joins at times
with a sonorous note. I crept down to the aisle to listen.
The harmonies, at first timid, grew gradually in volume
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
and power, till at length they swelled into glorious
music that filled the whole place, and held every ear entranced.
Then the organ broke out with an exulting
response, and all the echoes of the lofty roof and soaring
arches repeated the sound, until there came a
sudden pause, in which you presently heard the faintest
of tones, like a plaintive wail, from the stringed instruments.
Then strength came once more to the trembling
notes, and again the strains which angels might have
stayed to hearken to floated through the air.</p>

<p>Where could such music come from? I felt constrained
to go up again to the organ-loft. There sat
the same boys carrying on their sports during the rests
and pauses&mdash;the same seedy men at the bellows&mdash;earthly
hands producing heavenly music which held
the listeners spell-bound.</p>

<p>For me the illusion was over, and I felt curious to
see what sort of men they were who in stately robes
had gone through the ceremonial at the altar. Surely
they would exhibit signs of spiritual life. I placed myself
close to the door by which they would have to
pass to the sacristy, and observed them as they withdrew.
They were men of sluggish feature, lit by no
gleam of spirituality, and walked as if released from a
wearisome duty. And the robes which seemed rich
and costly in the distance, showed faded and shabby
near at hand&mdash;unworthy attire for priests of a church
that boasts a silver shrine. Here, thought I, we must
not look for the Beauty of Holiness.</p>

<p>Many a kiss did I see imprinted on the sacred picture
of Christ as the congregation departed; and then, as
they streamed forth and dispersed in groups in many
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
directions, I hastened forwards to catch the view of
the many-coloured procession as it descended the great
stair, flaunting in the sun between the gray old houses.</p>

<p>While crossing the ancient bridge for the last time,
my impression was strengthened that from thence you
get the best view of Prague&mdash;a view which conceals
the damaging features seen from the hills. "Oh! it is
a ravishing prospect!" exclaims an old topographer;
"your eye knows not whether it shall repose on the
mighty colossus of stone which appears to bid defiance
to the broad Moldau stream, or whether it shall pasture
on that romantic slope, from the summit of which the
huge imperial fortress, and the highly-famed cathedral
church, together with many palaces and churches, shine
down upon you. Surprise, wonder, and bewilderment
overcome him who for the first time turns hither and
thither to look at the sight." If your raptures rise not
to this lofty pitch, you will hardly fail, even at your
last view, to sympathise with the antiquated narrator's
enthusiasm.</p>

<p>The <i>Schwarzes Ross</i> has a worthy reputation, and
deserves it, for the entertainment is good, the plenishing
clean, and the beer excellent. Dinner is served,
after the Carlsbad manner, at twenty or more small
tables&mdash;an arrangement which favours conversation; and
after the soup has disappeared, the host enters with his
best coat on&mdash;a plump man, whose appearance does
honour to his own viands&mdash;and he makes a solemn bow
to every table. I had the happiness of catching his eye
on three successive days.</p>

<p>It was not by enchantment&mdash;though it seemed like it&mdash;but
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">158</a></span>
by steam, that, four hours later, having lost the
way, I was trudging about in swampy meadows at the
foot of the <i>Milleschauer</i>. My mind was confused with
pictures of Prague, with glimpses of the journey, and,
unawares, I had wandered from the track. At two
miles from the city our train was entered by two
soldiers, one of whom stood guard at the carriage door,
while the other went from passenger to passenger demanding
passports, that he might inspect the visas.
This done, the <i>Podiebrad</i>&mdash;so the locomotive was named&mdash;hurried
us past fruitful slopes, orchards, and poppy-fields;
past bends of the river; between hills that come
together in one place and form a glen, where tunnels
pierce the projecting crags; across a broad plain, till at
Raudnitz we saw the Elbe, and peaks and ridges in the
distance, indicating our approach to the mountains. At
Theresienstadt we stopped twenty minutes for the passing
of the train from Dresden, there being but a single
line of rails, beguiling the time by looking at the rafts
on the river, and the broken line of hills. Then to
Lobositz, where the folk appeared less wise than at
Prague, for the flour-mill and chicory-factory were
rattling and roaring in full work.</p>

<p>I left my knapsack at the <i>Gasthof zum Fürst Schwarzenberg</i>,
and started for the <i>Milleschauer</i>. Half an hour
along the Töplitz road, bordered all the way by fruit-trees,
and you come in sight of the mountain&mdash;a huge
cone, two thousand seven hundred feet in height, one of
the highest points of the <i>Mittelgebirge</i>. At the village of
Wellemin you leave the road for an obscure track across
uneven slopes; and here it was that, keeping too faithfully
to the left, according to direction, I lost the way.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span></p>

<p>I was trying back, when a fierce squall swept up from
the west. The sky grew dark, the rain fell in torrents,
the mountain disappeared shrouded in gloom, and from
the woods that clothe its sides from base to cope, tormented
by the cold wind, there came a roar as of the
sea in a storm. I took shelter behind a thick-stemmed
willow, and waited; but twilight crept on before the
growl ceased. There were paths enough to choose
from, too many, in fact, as there commonly are round
the base of minor hills; however, by dint of making way
upwards, through dripping copse and plashy glades, I
came at last to a single track, completely hidden by the
woods.</p>

<p>It was part of a great spiral winding round the cone&mdash;now
rising, now falling, but reaching always a higher
elevation. The clouds still hung overhead; the sun had
set, and under the trees I could see but a few yards
ahead. I stopped at times to listen for some companionable
sound, but heard only the heavy drip-drip from the
leaves, and melancholy sighs among the branches. A
little higher, and there, in the beds of moss around the
roots, gleamed the tiny lanterns of swarms of glowworms&mdash;more
than ever I had seen before&mdash;and the way felt
less lonely with the pale green rays in view. Moreover,
holding my watch near one of the tiny lanterns, it was
possible to see the hour&mdash;half-past nine. Farther on I
came to a little wagon standing in a gap, and then the
path became exceedingly steep and hard to climb, and
scarcely discernible in the increasing darkness. Steeper
and steeper grew the path, and with it the prospect
of a bivouac, when the trees thinned away, and a dark
barrier stopped further advance. It was a rough stone
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
wall, along which I felt my way, and coming presently
to a door, kicked upon it vigorously. A dog barked.
Footsteps approached, and a man's voice asked:</p>

<p>"Who's there?"</p>

<p>"An Englishman."</p>

<p>"Good," replied the voice; and forthwith the bolt
was shot, and the door opened. A man, whom I could
scarcely see in the darkness, took my arm and led me
down a short steep path, and round a corner into a
small gloomy room, dimly lighted by a single lamp.
Presently he brought another lamp, and then I saw that
the seeming gloom was an effect of colour only, for the
low apartment was lined with dark brown moss; a
settee, thickly covered with the same production, ran
from end to end along each side; and overhead you saw,
resting on unhewn rafters, the rough underside of a
mossy roof.</p>

<p>To find such a sylvan retreat, comfortably warmed,
too, by a stove, was an agreeable surprise. I stretched
myself on the soft and springy couch, while the man
went away to get my supper. He soon returned with
a savoury cutlet and a pitcher of good beer; and while
I enjoyed the cheer with an appetite sharpened by exercise,
he sat down to talk. The place, he said, belonged
to him. It comprised a group of huts, all built
of poles and moss, in which he had often lodged sixty
guests at once. There were a few sitting-rooms and
many bedrooms, a garden, a dancing-floor, an oratory,
a poultry-yard, pigeon-house, and other benevolent contrivances,
as I should be able to see in the morning.
The wagon which I had seen at the foot of the steep
belonged to him. It was hard work for a horse to drag
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
it up heavily laden; but harder still to carry the stores
from thence on one's shoulder to the summit. He came
up in May with his first load, and set to work to repair
roofs, walls, and fences, to renew the moss and dry the
beds, and then stayed till October busy with guests, who
arrived by tens or twenties every day, chiefly from Töplitz,
about ten miles distant. The voices we heard from
time to time in an adjoining hut were those of a
party of four, who had come from the fashionable spa to
see the sun set, and had been disappointed by the storm.
Perhaps sunrise would repay them. They and I were,
as it happened, the only guests this night, so the host
had time to talk without interruption.</p>

<p>Supper over, he went before me with a lantern through
the cold night wind to a hut some yards distant, where,
with a friendly "<i>Gute Nacht</i>," he left me. What a
snug little mossy chamber! At one end two beds&mdash;thick
piles of moss with plenty of blankets, and sheets
as clean as pure water and mountain breezes can make
them. At the other, two washstands, a looking-glass,
and little window. I had it all to myself, and was soon
sound asleep.

</p>

<p class="p2">Sunrise! a bell rings loudly to waken the sleepers;
and the host cries "<i>Frisch auf!</i>" at the door of the hut.
I was up as the first rays from the great luminary
streamed across the landscape. Not a cloud dimmed
the sky, and it was a grand sight to see the ruddy light
kindle on all the lower hill-tops, tremble on the tall
clumps of forest, and creep down the slopes, till field
after field caught the beams, and ponds glistened and
windows twinkled. And anon the thin veil of mist
was lifted from the valleys, and farms and villages rejoiced
in the new-born day. Every moment the great
panorama revealed more and more of its features, and
bits of cliff, and glenlike hollows, ruined towers, and
miles of road emerged from the obscure.</p>

<p>And while the light strengthened, there stretched towards
the west the mighty shadow of the mountain
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
itself, eclipsing acres of the landscape, which lay dim
between the streaming radiance rushing to an apex on
either side. But the sun mounts apace, and the shadow
grows shorter continually.</p>

<p>The number of cone-like hills is remarkable, and here
and there you see one of those circular, flat-topped elevations
bristling with dark woods, which characterize
much of Bohemian scenery along the Saxon frontier.
While gazing on the singular forms, you may imagine
them to be the crumbling remains of stupendous columns
erected by giant hands in the old primeval ages.</p>

<p>In the distance you see the Elbe, a long, pale stripe,
resembling a narrow lake, and you wish there were
more of it, for the want of water is a sensible defect in
the view. The region is fruitful and well peopled: had
it a few large lakes besides, your eye would roam over
it with the greater pleasure. The expanse is wide. In
very clear weather, so mine host assured me, you can
see Prague, and <i>Schneekoppe</i> in the <i>Riesengebirge</i>, each
fifty miles distant.</p>

<p>To enable you to get the view all round clear of the
trees a circular wooden tower is built, from the platform
of which you may gaze on far and near. Immediately
beneath you look down into the walled enclosure, upon
the huts, the flower-beds, the potato plot, the sheltering
hazel copse, and all the ins and outs of the place. You
see mossy arbours open to the south, and little nooks
where you may recline at ease and contemplate different
points of the view.</p>

<p>I was glad after awhile to take refuge in one of these
nooks, for the wind blew so strong and keen that my
teeth chattered as I walked round the platform. However,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
there is steaming coffee ready to fortify you
against the influences which mar the poetry of sunrise.</p>

<p>The garden, sheltered by its wall and screen of hazel,
teems with flowers, a pleasing sight as you go and
come in your explorations. I surveyed the whole premises
from the dairy to the dancing-floor; noted the
inscriptions here and there with which the owner seeks
to conciliate your good opinion; looked at his bazaar,
where you may buy <i>Recollections of the Milleschauer</i>,
and so round to the little altar under the bell. Here the
inscription runs:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_180.jpg" width="199" height="138" alt="" />
</div>
<p class="center s09 p2">
Frisch auf!<br />
Zur Arbeit dran,<br />
Gott segne meine Plan:<br />
denn<br />
An Gottes Segen<br />
Ist Alles gelegen.</p>

<p class="p2">Two hours passed. I took a farewell view under the
broad sunlight, and then, having to meet a steamer at
Lobositz, strode merrily down the hill. What a pleasant
walk that was! Once below the summit, among
the trees, and the temperature was that of a summer
morning; and the woods looked glorious, fringed with
light reflected from millions of raindrops&mdash;memorials of
the former evening's storm, now become things of
beauty. Beech, birch, and hazel, intermingled with
larch and fir, robe the hill from base to cope, through
which the path descends with continued windings; an
ever-shifting aisle, as it seems, overarched by green
leaves, among which you hear the gladsome chirp and
warbling of birds. All the breaks and hollows which
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
appeared so grim and gloomy the night before, the
mouths of yawning caverns, now open as narrow glades
or twinkling bowers, in which a thousand lights dart
and quiver as the cheerful breeze sweeps through,
caressing the leaves. Such a walk favours cheerful
meditation, and prepares your heart for cloudy weather
and dreary prospects; and in after days many a thought
born within the wood flits back on the memory.</p>

<p>It was like having been robbed of something to step
out of the woods upon the rough grassy slopes at the
foot of the hill, and presently to tramp along a hard,
beaten road. However, there was the sight of the lofty
cone rising in its forest vesture high into the sunlight
for repayment; and the lively breeze ceased not to
blow.</p>

<p>The ill-favoured clerk at Prague had refused to accredit
me beyond Lobositz, so here at nine o'clock I
had to go to the <i>Bezirksamt</i> for another visa. Again did
I request that the name of some place at the foot of the
mountains, or beyond the frontier, might be inserted;
but no! I was going a trip down the Elbe, with intention
to disembark at Tetschen, so for Tetschen the visa
was made out, and the clerk, who was very polite,
wished me a pleasant journey.</p>

<p>I found a number of passengers waiting at the river
side, reclining on the grass or strolling among the trees.
Presently came a large flat boat and conveyed us all to
an island, where, by the time we had assembled on the
rude landing stage, the steamer <i>Germania</i> arrived and
took us on board; not without difficulty, for the deck
was literally choked with queer-looking people and
rubbishy baggage. What could such a company be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
travelling for? Wedged in among them sat a party
of wandering musicians, men and women, with harps,
guitars, fiddles, and flute: the space all too narrow for
their movements. However, as soon as the vessel
resumed her course down the rapid stream they began
to play, and kept up a succession of airs that seemed to
convert the exhilarating motion, the breeze and the
sunshine into frolicsome music.</p>

<p>I got a seat on the top of a heap of bundles, with
clear outlook above the heads of the crowd. It was a
delightful voyage, between scenes growing more and
more romantic at every bend of the river. Now we
shoot past scarped hills, split by narrow gullies dark
with foliage, from whence little brooks leap forth to the
light; now past sheltered coombs where rural homesteads
nestle, and vines hang on the sunny slopes; now
past variegated cliffs, all ochre and gray, that come near
together, and compel the stream to swerve with boiling
eddies and long trains of impatient ripples; now past
fields and meadows where the retiring hills leave room
for fruitful husbandry, and from far your eye catches
the speck of colour&mdash;the red or blue petticoats of the
women around the hay-wagons.</p>

<p>And along the road which skirts the shore there go
men and women, horses and vehicles, and there is
always something strange to note in costume and
appearance. And close by runs the railway, its course
marked by the painted wicker balloons hanging aloft on
the signal posts, and the bright colour of the jutting
rocks through which the way is hewn, or by a train
dashing past with echoing snort and tail of cloud.</p>

<p>The hills crowd closer and higher at every bend.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
Here and there rises a cliff forming an imposing palisade
of rock; then comes a wild mass of crags backed by
woods that screen a little red-roofed chapel perched
high aloft; then the tower of <i>Schreckenstein</i> comes
into view, crowning a tall, gray buttress, which gives a
finishing touch to the picturesque.</p>

<p>My attention was diverted from the scenery by a leaf
of music held out by one of the musicians. Who could
refuse a fee for such strains as theirs? Kreutzer after
kreutzer, a few small silver coins, and two or three
twopenny bank-notes were dropped into the receptacle,
which was presently emptied into the ready hands of
the fluteplayer. He counted, shook his head, and saying,
"Not enough yet!" gave the signal for a fresh
burst. Now came forth music singularly wild and
inspiriting&mdash;the reserve, perhaps, for an emergency&mdash;and
none within hearing could resist its influence.
Had there been room, every one would surely have
danced; as it was, eyes sparkled, heads wagged, and
fingers snapped, keeping time with the measure. There
seemed something magical about the leader, and I
could not help fancying that her fiddle began to speak
before the bow had touched the strings. They speak
wisely who bid us go to Bohemia for music.</p>

<p>The leaf went round once more, and not in vain; but
the fluteplayer still shook his head, whereupon a song
and a duet were sung; and then the flute, brought to a
conclusion with his cares, went to the little crib by the
paddle-box and bought tickets for the whole party.</p>

<p>Then Aussig came into sight, and I soon ceased to
wonder whither the queer-looking crowd were going.
It was to Aussig fair. Bundle after bundle was pulled
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
so rapidly from the heap on which I reclined that I was
quickly brought down to the level of the deck, and a
scramble and hubbub arose easier to be imagined than
described. The musicians made haste to put the
leathern covers on their instruments, and along with
her fiddle I saw that the leader buckled up a spare stay-bone
and a few miscellaneous articles of her toilet. The
women carried the harps, and the men huge knapsacks,
stuffed with their wives' gear as well as their own, and
with a thick-soled boot staring out from either end.
Once at the landing, a few minutes sufficed to clear the
deck, and no sooner had the vagabonds departed than a
boy came with a broom, and all was presently made
clean, as behoved in a vessel bound to Dresden.</p>

<p>Half an hour's stay gives you time to look at Aussig,
to admire its pleasing environment, its busy boat-builders,
and gondola-like pleasure-boats floating on
the stream, and to commend the good quality of its
beer. Among the passengers who came on board were
a party of students, certain of them wearing gowns not
larger than a jacket&mdash;which, as some say, betoken learning
in proportion.</p>

<p>Away we went again, and always with fairer landscapes
to greet our eyes. Past great high-prowed
barges, towed slowly against the current by horses;
past small barges, towed still more slowly by a dozen or
twenty men. Past the <i>Spürlingstein</i>, and bastion-like
cliffs, and hollows, beyond which you catch sight of
far-away peaks. Then a village of timbered houses,
the fronts showing broad lines of chequer-work and
quaint gables, and every house standing apart in its
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
own garden, among hills hung with woods to the
water's edge; and rocks peering out here and there from
the shadow of the trees, shutting you in all round as in
a lake.</p>

<p>The sight of the varied features which open on you,
increasing in beauty at every bend, will suggest frequent
comparison. Here among the hills nature hems
the Elbe in with loveliness, as if to prepare the great
river for its long, dreary course from Dresden to the sea.
You see not so many castles, but more variety than on
the Rhine; more of untamed scenery, and less of monotonous
vine-slopes; and perhaps you will incline to agree
with those who hold that from Leitmeritz to Pirna the
Elbe excels the far-famed stream that flows past Cologne.</p>

<p>Beautiful is the view of Tetschen, backed by grand
wooded hills; the river, spanned by a chain-bridge,
making a sudden bend; the castle looking down on the
stream from a forward cliff. Though topped by a
spire, the castle will inevitably remind you of a factory;
and you will be constrained to look away from it to the
tunnelled cliff through which the railway passes, and the
noisy stream that tumbles in on the opposite side.</p>

<p>It had just struck one when I landed. The passport
office was shut for two hours, that the functionaries
might have time to dine&mdash;a praiseworthy arrangement,
though trying at times to a traveller's patience. I
dined at the <i>Golden Crown</i>, at one side of the great
square, and regaled myself with a flask of <i>Melniker</i>&mdash;a
right generous wine. The inn is the starting place for
some twenty coaches and vans, and, looking round on
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
the numerous guests as they went and came, it was easy
to see you had left the Czechish for the German part of
the population&mdash;oval faces for round ones.</p>

<p>In the centre of the square stands a building, which,
in appearance a pedestal for a big statue, is a little
chapel in which mass is said twice a day. I spent a
few minutes in looking at it, then strolled to the castle
garden and the bridge, from whence I saw carts backed
axle deep into the river to receive cotton bales from a
barge, and women loading a boat wading out above
their knees with heavy sacks on their shoulders. Then
to the school&mdash;a sight that gave me real pleasure, so
spacious is the building, so numerous are the scholars,
so earnest the master in his work. His discourse was
that of one who has found his true vocation: he was
seldom cast down, and felt persuaded that it was a
master's own fault if he had no joy in his scholars.
After our few brief words I thought the inscription at
the door yet more appropriate:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_186.jpg" width="383" height="24" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="poetry-container p2">
<div class="poem">
<p>Der Schule Saat reift für Zeit und Ewigkeit.<a name="FNanchor_B" id="FNanchor_B" href="#Footnote_B" class="fnanchor">[B]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>At three o'clock I sought out the passport clerk, and
found him not a whit more willing to give a visa for
the mountains, or a place over the border, than his
fellows elsewhere. He admitted the argument that one
of the pleasures of travel was an unrestricted choice or
change of route, but "could not" do more; so I looked
at my map, and chose Reichenberg as my next point of
departure, and the official stamp and signature were
forthwith applied. But the gentleman discovered an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
irregularity, and did not let me depart till it was
rectified&mdash;that the leaves containing the visas and the
passport were separate sheets. He fastened them together
with a broad seal and a loop of black and yellow
thread, and then wished me a pleasant journey.</p>

<p>The wish was realized, for the route lies through a
pretty country, the most populous and industrious part
of Bohemia. It is heavy uphill work soon after leaving
Tetschen, but the view from the top over the valley of
the Elbe repays the labour, and rivals that from the
<i>Milleschauer</i>. A little farther, and the prospect opens
in the opposite direction, across a great wave, as it
seems, of cones, ridges, scars, and rounded heights,
sprinkled with spires and hamlets&mdash;a cheerful scene that
invites you onwards.</p>

<p>At every mile you see and hear more and more of
the signs of industry. Men pass you wheeling barrows
laden with coloured glass rods&mdash;material for beads and
fragile toys, to be manufactured at home in their own
little cottages, keeping up the olden practice. Now
you hear the hiss and whiz of the polishing wheel; now
the rattle of looms, and the croak of stocking-weavers.
And at times comes a man pushing before him a great
barrowful of bread&mdash;large, flat, brown loaves&mdash;on his
way to supply the off hamlets which have no bakery.
And now and then old women creep by, bending under
a burden of firewood. Two whom I overtook told me
they walked three miles twice a week to fetch a bundle
of sticks from the forest; and when I asked if they ate
meat or cheese, answered with a "<i>Gott bewahr!</i> never.
Nothing but bread and potatoes."</p>

<p>At Markersdorf I left the highway for a cross-road,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
leading through a succession of hamlets, so close together
that you can hardly tell where one begins and
the other ends. Now the signs of labour multiply, and
there is a ceaseless noise of the shuttle and polishing
wheel. The little houses have a very rustic appearance,
built of squared logs black with age, set off by stripes of
white clay along all the joints, and a stripe of green
paint around the windows. There is variety in their
architecture: some imitate the Swiss style, with tall
roofs and outside galleries; some exhibit dumpy gables
and arched timbers along the lower story; and pretty
they look in the midst of their poppy-strewn gardens
and embowering orchards, watered by little brooks,
which here and there set little mills a-clacking.</p>

<p>Not a hamlet without its school; and you will see
with pleasure how the importance of the school is recognised.
Over the door of one at Gersdorf I read:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_188a.jpg" width="358" height="58" alt="" />
</div>
<div class="poetry-container p2">

<p>O laß sie alle, alle kommen.<a name="FNanchor_C" id="FNanchor_C" href="#Footnote_C" class="fnanchor">[C]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>At Meistersdorf, a furlong or two farther, on a little
hill that overlooks miles of country, the school-house is
one of the best buildings in the place. And here again
a rhyming couplet, embodying a benevolent sentiment,
crosses the lintel:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_188.jpg" width="463" height="73" alt="" />
</div>

<div class="poetry-container p2">
<div class="poem">
<p>Kommt hier zu mir ihr Kleinen, O kommt mit frommen Sinn</p>
<p>Ich führ den Weg des Heilen euch zu dem Vater hin.<a name="FNanchor_D" id="FNanchor_D" href="#Footnote_D" class="fnanchor">[D]</a></p>
</div></div>
<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span></p>

<p>And the children really are taught. Scarcely a day
passed that I did not stop boys and girls on the highway,
and get them to talk about their school and what they
learned. Not one did I meet above the age of eight
who could not read and write, and do a little arithmetic,
or recite the multiplication table, as I fully ascertained
by sitting down on the bank and playing the schoolmaster&mdash;not
a frowning one&mdash;myself. They answered
readily, and wrote words on a scrap of paper, and
seemed pleased to show off what they knew, and still
more pleased at finding a kreutzer in their hand when
the questions ended. In many of the schools the pupils
may learn mathematics if they will, and drawing is
taught in all. To this early acquaintance with the
rules of art the Bohemian glass engravers are indebted
for a resource that enables them to make the most of
their skill and ingenuity. The school fees are from one
penny to twopence a week.</p>

<p>A short distance beyond the school I left the village
road for a rough byeway across fields, and after a walk
of five hours from Tetschen came to a row of wooden
cottages, or farmsteads, as they might be called, each
standing apart in its own ground, flanked by sheds, and
fortified by a dungheap close to the door. Were it not
for overhanging trees and garden plots they would wear
a shabby look.</p>

<p>Ulrichsthal was my destination; but here was no
valley, only a slope. However, on inquiring at the
last but one in the row of cottages, I found that I was
really in Ulrichsthal, and at the very door I wanted.

</p>

<p class="p2">I once promised a Bohemian glass engraver, who
showed me specimens of his skill under the murky sky
of ugly Birmingham, that when the favourable time
came I would find out his native place, and have a talk
with his kinsfolk. The favourable time had come in
all ways, for no sooner did I make myself known to the
old man who was summoned to the door, than he took
my hand and said, "Be welcome to my house." Suiting
action to word, he led me into a large, low room, hot as
an oven, where his wife and daughters and a sweetheart
sat chatting away the dusk. At first they were somewhat
shy; but when I brought out a little letter from
the son in England, and the eldest daughter, having
lit a candle, read it aloud, the mother, overjoyed at
hearing news from "our Wilhelm," sprang up, gave
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
me a kiss, and cried, "Only think, an Englishman is
come to see us!" Here was an end to the shyness; and
having shaken hands with all the lasses and the sweetheart,
I became as one of the family.</p>

<p>Of course I would stay all night; they could not
think of letting me go to seek quarters at the public-house,
unless, indeed, their own rustic entertainment
would make me uncomfortable; and the entreaties were
accompanied by preparations for supper. Who could
resist such hearty hospitality? Not I; and forthwith an
understanding prevailed that whatever pleased them best
would please me best; excepting, that I should have
leave to open one of the casements and sit close to it,
for to me the temperature of the room was unbearable.
Besides the heat from the stove, there was an odour of
kine from the cowstall, which forms one half of the
house, separated from the living room only by a passage.</p>

<p>We had merry talk while I ate my supper of eggs,
coffee, and bread and butter. "Our Wilhelm" was, however,
the mother's favourite topic, and she returned to it
again and again. She must tell me, too, of her other
sons, one in America, another at Pesth; and how that
one night they were all awoke by a loud knocking at
the door, and a voice begging for a night's lodging.
How that the stranger would not go away, but continued
to knock and beseech, until all at once the mother
recognised a tone, and cried, "Father, father, open
the door! That's our David's voice. Our David,
come home to see us, all the way from Hungary!" And
then the joyful meeting that followed! Her eyes glistened
with tears as she told me this.</p>

<p>There were two beds in a little slip of a chamber
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
opening from the principal room, of which the one
nearest the window was given up to me, as I again had
to stipulate for an open casement; and the more so, as
notwithstanding the heat, I was expected to bury myself
between two feather-beds, as the custom of the country
is; the other was occupied by the old man. As for
mother and daughters, they retreated to some place
overhead, which must have been very like a loft.</p>

<p>Had I slept well? was the question next morning;
and this being answered in the affirmative, the family
resolved by acclamation that I should stay with them a
fortnight at least, nor would they at first believe that I
could only spare them a single day. Could not an
Englishman do anything? What mattered it if I returned
to London a week sooner or later? The theatre
at Steinschönau would be opened on Sunday, and it
would be such a nice walk to go and see the play.
Why should I be in a hurry to reach the mountains?
Would it not be the same if I went to the top of all the
hills around Ulrichsthal?</p>

<p>So said the daughters, with much more of the like
purport, and to resist persuasions backed by bright eyes,
good looks, and blithesome voices, was a hard trial for
my philosophy. However, I kept my resolution even
when the mother rounded up with, "Only a day! that's
not long enough to taste all my cookery." The good
soul had risen early to make fresh <i>Semmel</i> for breakfast.</p>

<p>To pacify them, I promised to eat as much as ever
I could, and to let them do whatever they liked with
me during the day. Thereupon two of the damsels put
on their broad-brimmed straw hats, shouldered their
rakes, and betook themselves to the hay-field; the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
youngest, a lassie of fifteen, apprenticed to a glass engraver,
said, "<i>Leb' wohl</i>," and went away to her work;
the old man, privileged to be idle through age and infirmity,
crept forth to find a sunshiny bit of grass on
which to have a snooze; the mother began to bustle with
pot and pan about the stove; and the eldest daughter,
having put on her hat and a pink scarf, claimed the right
to show me all that was worth seeing in Ulrichsthal.</p>

<p>We began with the room itself. Its furniture was
simple enough: wooden walls and ceiling; an uncomfortable
wooden seat fixed to the wall along two sides; a
table and a few wooden chairs; and the old man's polishing-bench,
a fixture in one corner. The treadle and crank
were still in place, but motionless; half a dozen wheels
and sundry tools hung on the wall, memorials of the
veteran's forty years of industry, and the bench did
duty as dresser and bookshelf. Among the books were
<i>Schiller's Werken</i>, in sixteen volumes, belonging to "our
Wilhelm." With that simple machinery, hoarsely
whirring day after day all through the prime of his
manhood, had he gained wherewith to buy his two
plots of land, and the comfort of repose in declining
age. Here, in this overheated room, at once workshop,
kitchen, and parlour, had been reared those four comely
daughters, and the tall son whom I had met in England;
all strong and hearty, in spite of high temperature and
certain noxious influences arising out of a want of proper
decency in the household economy. "We are used
to it," was the answer, when I expressed my surprise
that they could bear to live familiar with things offensive,
and yet fearful of a passing breath from spring and
summer. But this want of perception is not confined
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">178</a></span>
to Ulrichsthal; you cannot help noticing it in many, if
not in most, Bohemian villages, and on the Silesian side
of the mountains.</p>

<p>But the damsel is impatient. We set off towards a
row of houses on a higher part of the slope. Each
has its long and narrow piece of land, an orchard immediately
behind the house; then patches of wheat, barley,
poppies, beetroot, grass, and potatoes, cultivated, with
few exceptions, by the several families. But labourers
can be hired when wanted, who are willing to work for
one or two florins a week.</p>

<p>We went into one of the houses. There sat a family
grinding and polishing glass, alternating field-work by a
day at the treadles. The operations were not new to
me, but there was novelty to see them carried on in
such a homely way; to see elegant vases, dishes, goblets,
and jugs, fit ornaments for a palace, in the hands of
rustics, or lying about on a rough pine shelf. The
father, a tall, pale-faced man, with a somewhat careworn
expression, stopped the noise of the wheels as soon as he
heard of a visitor from London, and talked about that
which he understood best&mdash;his business. Full thirty
years had he sat at the bench, training up his children
to the work one after another, but had not realized all
the benefits he once hoped for. The brittle ware came
to him in boxes from Prague, forty-five miles, and, when
polished, was sent back in the same way; he having to
bear the loss of whatever was broken while in his hands.
"Look here," he said, showing me a large handsome
jug; "my daughter spent a whole month over that jug,
and then, as you see, broke the handle off. So I must
keep it, and lose fifteen florins." To him it was useless:
he could only place it apart with other crippled specimens&mdash;memorials
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
of misfortune. "Ah! if glass would
not break, then he would not be poor. However," he
added, "we always get bread. God be thanked! And
our bit of land helps." Cutters and polishers earn about
four florins a week. He thought it good that young
men got away to England, for they not only earned
great wages, but escaped the remorseless military service.
"A young man is not safe here: perhaps he works
for twelve, eighteen months, and thinks he will be left
quiet for the rest of his term, when all at once comes a
sharp order, and he must away to Italy for a year or two."</p>

<p>Then he set his treadle going, to show me that in
Bohemia the polisher holds his glass against the bottom
of the wheel, and, consequently, has the work always
under his eye; while, in England, he holds it against
the top of the wheel, and must be always turning it over
to look at the surface.</p>

<p>Higher up the slope we came to another house,
where, instead of the harsh sound of grinding, we heard
but a faint, busy hum. A change came over Röschen's
manner as she entered, and saw a young man sitting at
a lathe; and their greeting, when he looked round, was
after the manner of lovers before a witness. On being
told that I had come to see glass engraving, the young
man plied his wheel briskly, and, taking up a ruby
tazza, in a few minutes there stood a deer with branching
antlers on a rough hillock in its centre&mdash;a pure
white intaglio set in the red. I had never before seen
the process, and was surprised by its simplicity. All
those landscapes, hunting-scenes, pastoral groups, and
whatever else which appear as exquisite carvings in
the glass, are produced by a few tiny copper wheels,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
or disks. The engraver sits at a small lathe against
a window, with a little rack before him, containing
about a score of the copper disks, varying in size
from the diameter of a halfpenny down to its thickness,
all mounted on spindles, and sharpened on
the edge. He paints a rough outline of the design
on the surface of the glass, and, selecting the disk
that suits best, he touches the edge with a drop of oil,
inserts it in the mandril, sets it spinning, and, holding
the glass against it from below, the little wheel eats
its way in with astonishing rapidity. The glass, held
lightly in the hands, is shifted about continually, till all
the greater parts of the figure are worked out; then, for
the lesser parts, a smaller disk is used, and at last the
finest touches, such as blades of grass, the tips of antlers,
eyebrows, and so forth, are put in with the smallest.
Every minute he holds the glass up between his eye and
the light, watching the development of the design; now
making a broad excavation, now changing the disk every
ten seconds, and giving touches so slight and rapid that
the unpractised eye can scarcely follow them; and in
this way he produces effects of foreshortening, of roundness,
and light and shade, which, to an eye-witness, appear
little less than wonderful.</p>

<p>The work in hand happened to be <i>tazzi</i>, and in less
than half an hour I saw deer in various positions roughed
out on six of them, and three completely finished. Then
the engraver fetched other specimens of his skill from
up-stairs&mdash;a dish with a historical piece in the centre,
and vignettes round the rim&mdash;a bowl engirdled by sylvan
scenes, where fauns and satyrs, jolly old Pan and bacchanals,
laughed out upon you from forest bowers and mazy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
vineyards&mdash;all, even to the twinkling eyes, the untrimmed
beards, and delicate tendrils, wrought out by
the copper wheels.</p>

<p>The merchants at Prague took care that he should
never lack work, and, according to the quality, he could
earn from four to eight florins a week, and save money.
Beef cost him 11 kreutzers the pound, veal 10, and salt
6 kreutzers. His bread was home-made. The lathe
was his own: it cost forty florins; and the house, and
the long strip of ground that sloped away behind, half
hidden by the orchard. He did no field-work, but left
that to his mother, who lived with him, and hired
labourers. "It goes better in the house where a woman
is," he said, with a glance at Röschen.</p>

<p>The cleanliness and order of his own room&mdash;workshop
though it was&mdash;justified his words. And though old
habit would not yet permit him to sit with open door
and window, he did not aggravate summer-heat by
stove-heat, but had a cooking-place in an outer shed.
His house had four rooms, of which two up-stairs, and a
loft&mdash;all built of wood. The floor of the room above
formed the ceiling, all the joints covered by a straight
sapling split down the middle, resting on joists big and
strong enough to carry a town-hall. Between these
massive timbers hung pictures of saints, a drawing of
trees, and a guitar. The engraver could play and sing,
and recreated himself with music in the evenings, and
on Sundays.</p>

<p>He had heard that the English were fond of music,
and thought there must be plenty of good singing among
the working-people; and it surprised him not a little to
be told that the Islanders' love for sweet sounds went far&mdash;far
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
beyond their power of producing them. "Ah!"
interrupted Röschen, "my brother writes that there is
no music in his English workmates' singing."</p>

<p>The engraver thought it a great privation, and could
not well comprehend how the evenings could pass agreeably
without a little music at home. "And when you
are away from home," he went on, "it seems still better.
Like all the young men here, I have been a soldier, have
marched to Bucharest, to Pesth, to Trent, and Innsbruck,
and what should we do on those long marches,
and in dull quarters, if we could not sing?"</p>

<p>Concerning the military service, he thought it a
hardship to be obliged to serve, whether or no, but
compensated by advantages. It added to a young man's
knowledge and experience to march to distant lands, to
see strange scenes, and strange people. You could
always tell the difference between one who had travelled,
even as a soldier, and a stay-at-home; the one had something
to talk about, the other had nothing. Then, the
pleasure of coming home again&mdash;a pleasure so sweet,
that the thought of marching forth once more could
hardly embitter it. For his part, he had been at home
eighteen months, glad to resume his craft, and for the
present saw no prospect of a call to arms. But there
remained yet one year of his term unexpired, and he
was liable at any moment to get an order requiring him
to leave everything, and march. "Who can tell," he
said, "how hard it is to go away so suddenly, to leave
the little home, and all friends? Right glad shall I be
when the year is over."</p>

<p>Röschen looked as if she would be glad too, and, to
make me aware of all the young man's cleverness, she
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
took down the frame of trees from the wall and put it
in my hands. I then saw that what looked like a
coloured drawing was a picture made of insects. The
engraver had a taste for natural history, and with a collection
of beetles of all sizes, black, brown, green, gold,
and sapphire, had constructed the group of trees which,
when looked at from the middle of the room, showed as
a highly-finished drawing. You saw here and there a
withered branch shooting from the foliage&mdash;it was nothing
but the horns and legs ingeniously placed, and
those deep hollows in the trunks, places where owls may
haunt, are produced by an artful arrangement of wings.</p>

<p>Then Röschen would have him fetch down his trays
of moths and portfolio of drawings. The moths had
all been collected in walks about the neighbourhood,
and were carefully preserved and labelled. The drawings
showed the hand of an artist. The engraver had
begun to learn to draw in school at the age of eleven,
and had practised ever since, for without good drawing
one could not engrave glass. He spoke of Röschen's
youngest sister as a real genius, who would one day outstrip
all the engravers in Ulrichsthal.</p>

<p>Bohemia was the first to rival, and soon to excel,
Venice in the art of glass-making. In her vast forests
she found exhaustless stores of fuel and potash, and
quartz and lime in her rocks, and produced a white
glass which won universal admiration until about the
beginning of last century, when English manufacturers
discovered the process for making flint-glass with oxyde
of lead as an ingredient. There was nothing superior
to this glass, so it has been said, but the diamond, and
the Bohemians, finding their craft in danger, introduced
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
coloured glass, frosted glass, and pleasing styles of ornament.
This practice they have since kept up. Their
works are mostly situate in the great forests on the
Bavarian frontier, where fuel and labour are alike cheap:
the managers are well taught, and have a good knowledge
of chemistry, and by striving always after something
new, reproducing at times long-forgotten Venice
patterns, they have achieved a reputation due more to
the taste and elegance displayed in the forms of their
manufactures than to their quality. From the rude
forest villages the articles are sent all across the kingdom
to the northern districts, where, as we have seen, the
finishing touches that are to fit them for stately halls and
drawing-rooms, are applied by the hands of humble
cottagers.</p>

<p>We were about to leave, when the engraver asked if
I would not like to try my hand at the lathe, and, without
waiting for an answer, he brought out a small,
plain beaker of thick glass, and begged me to cut a
forget-me-not upon it as a memorial of my visit. The
process looked so easy, that I thought there would be
no great risk in an attempt, so I sat down, spread out
my elbows to rest upon the cushions, put my foot to the
treadle, and the glass to the wheel. Whiz&mdash;skirr-r-r-r, and
there was a fine white blur which, by a stretch of fancy,
might have been taken for a cloud. Karl&mdash;as Röschen
called him&mdash;took the beaker, and, leaning across me as
I sat, speedily converted the blur into a rose, and bade
me try again. I presented the opposite side, and this
time with better effect, for the result was a very passable
forget-me-not. I have seen many a worse on <i>A
Trifle from Margate</i>.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span></p>

<p>Röschen then said something about meeting in the
evening, and we made haste home, for it was dinner-time.
Immediately on arrival she proceeded to roll out
a small piece of dry brown dough into a thin sheet,
which she cut into strips, and these strips, laid three or
four together, and shredded down very thin, produced
an imitation of vermicelli, which was thrown into the
soup.</p>

<p>Now all was ready, and a proud woman was the
mother as the soup was followed by two kinds of meat,
stewed and roast&mdash;salad, potatoes, and a cool, slightly
acid preserve, made from forest berries. And for drink
there was pale beer from the <i>Wirthshaus</i>. She did not
fail to remind me of my promise to "eat a plenty."</p>

<p>Nor, after we had sipped our coffee, did Röschen fail
to remind me of my morning's surrender, and pointing to
the high hill-top, about two miles off, she said, "I mean
to take you up there." So, as my docility remained unimpaired,
we braved the hot sun, and had a very pretty
walk over broken ground, and down into a bosky valley,
watered by a noisy brook, before we reached the hill-foot.
Then flowery meads, and presently the shadow of
a forest, where we regaled ourselves with a second dessert
of juicy bilberries and wild strawberries, both growing
in profusion. From a little clearing, not far from the
top, we saw heaving darkly against the blue, the hills of
the Saxon Switzerland. The last bit was steep and
pathless; but at length we came out upon a little hollow
platform, the summit of a precipice, from which, the
trees diverging and sinking on either hand, there was a
grand view over the vale we had left, and far away,
over field and hamlet, meadow and coppice, to a wavy
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
line of hills, gray, purple, green, and brown, blended on
the horizon. We sat for an hour; and after scanning
the principal features Röschen pointed out the details,
naming every house and field within a great sweep.
Each man's little property lay distinctly mapped out,
and we could see the neighbours and her sisters working
in the sunshine.</p>

<p>Our way back led us across the hay-field, where the
lasses were bustling to finish in time for some evening's
diversion, the nature of which was a secret. I proposed
to help them, threw off my coat, seized a fork, and
flung the hay up to the lass in the wagon quicker than
she could trim it. Röschen took a rake, and had enough
to do in gathering up the heaps which, pitching too vigorously,
I sent clean over the wagon. All at once, as
I was stooping, down came a mountain on my back,
and the three lasses, taking advantage of my fall, came
piling heap on heap above me&mdash;Pelion upon Ossa&mdash;till
I was well-nigh smothered, and they went almost wild
with laughter. They sat down to recover themselves;
but when they saw me, after laborious thrust and heave,
come creeping ingloriously out, their jocund mirth broke
out again, and provoked me into a spirit of retaliation.</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"As bees flee hame wi' lades o' treasure,</p>
<p>The minutes wing'd their way wi' pleasure."</p>
</div></div>

<p>Then we fell to work once more, and when the wagon
was laden I showed to the ragged urchin who was hired
to drive, three of the lumbering old copper coins, bigger
than penny-pieces, which pass for kreutzers in the neighbourhood,
and at sight thereof he made the old horse
drag the load home and come back for another in less
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
time than horse had ever accomplished the task in Ulrichsthal.
The second load was the last: by the time it
was all pitched up our shadows grew long, and we followed
it up to the house, where the mother had coffee
and <i>Semmel</i> ready for us.</p>

<p>Now Röschen, reminding me once more of my promise
to be tractable, revealed the secret. Karl was
coming down, and Gottfried&mdash;the sweetheart I had seen
the night before&mdash;and perhaps another, and then we
were all to go to the <i>Wirthshaus</i>, about half an hour's
walk. Presently the young men came in, and the lasses
having changed their rustic garb for holiday gowns and
dangling gold ear-drops, we walked in procession across
fields to the rendezvous. A shout of welcome greeted
our arrival from the young fellows already assembled&mdash;the
Londoner was duly introduced, and treated by the
host with especial favour, and we all sat down to a
table, every man with his tankard of beer. The cup
circulated literally, the custom being that everybody
should drink from everybody's tankard. The lasses
took their turn, though modestly and with discretion, as
became them. The talk crackled merrily for awhile,
and when it flagged a small tray bearing a set of little
ninepins which were to be knocked down by a teetotum
was placed on the table. The pins were so contrived
that they could be all erected at once by pulling a
string at one end of the tray, and the game went round
not less briskly than the tankards, shouts of laughter repaying
him who set the teetotum a-spinning without
molestation to the pins. Then I proposed a song, and
Karl charmed all ears with a musical ditty: another
followed with a harmonious ballad, which had a chorus
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
for burden, and as the tuneful harmony filled the room
I could not help contrasting it with what would have
been heard in a similar rustic alehouse in England.
The ballad led to a talk about poetry, and one and
another recited stanzas of favourite poems, and all
seemed familiar with the best authors, drawing illustrations
from Bürger's <i>Lenore</i>, Schiller's <i>Song of the
Bell</i>, Goethe's <i>Erl King</i>, and one or two ventured upon
the <i>Niebelungenlied</i>.</p>

<p>The moon was high in heaven when we broke up,
and gently the night wind swept across the fields laden
with the freshness of dew. As we walked along the
narrow paths Gottfried had to undergo a test: his
maiden plucked a large ox-eye daisy, pulled the petals
off one by one, keeping time with a few spoken surmises<a name="FNanchor_E" id="FNanchor_E" href="#Footnote_E" class="fnanchor">[E]</a>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"<i>Du liebst mich vom Herzen,</i></p>
<p class="i7"><i>mit Schmerzen,</i></p>
<p class="i9"><i>ein Wenig,</i></p>
<p class="i6"><i>oder gar nicht.</i>"</p>
</div></div>

<p>The last petal came off with <i>vom Herzen</i>, but yet the
inquirer was not quite content. It was all very well to
be loved <i>from the heart</i>; but <i>with pain</i> or <i>grief</i>
would have been much better. Then nothing would
do but Röschen must try the experiment on me, and
reciting and plucking she went round the frail circlet,
and ended with <i>gar nicht</i>. She looked curiously
at Karl, and Karl looked as if he were not by any
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
means dissatisfied that she had got <i>not at all</i> for a conclusion.</p>

<p>It was past twelve when we came to our door, and
then "farewell" had to be said, and "adieu till to-morrow;"
and so ended for me a day of rural life that I
shall long remember.</p>

<p>If, reader, you should ever pay a visit of inquiry to
the Ulrichsthalers, I feel assured they will tell you that
next to themselves the best fellow in the world is an
Englishman.

</p>

<p class="p2">Fresh <i>Semmel</i> for breakfast again the next morning,
and renewed entreaties for my stay. I could only reply
by putting on my knapsack. The old man grieved that
infirmity prevented his showing me the shortest way to
Hayda, some ten miles distant, where I should strike
the main road. "But," he said, "Röschen knows the
way, and she will be glad to go. I can trust her with
you, for you are an Englishman."</p>

<p>I felt bound to thank him for his compliment to my
nationality, and not less for the unexpected pleasure of
his daughter's company. Röschen went to put on her
round hat, and then the mother said she would like to
go too, "just a little half-hour," and tied on her kerchief.
Then I had to give a kiss to the rest of the
family&mdash;barring the old man&mdash;and with cordial hand-grip
and many a good-bye I stepped from beneath the
hospitable roof.</p>

<p>The day was as bright and breezy as heart could
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
wish, and it was delightful walking in and out, choosing
the short cuts across the fields. The "little half-hour"
brought us to a great cross by the wayside, where the
mother, who lamented all the way that I would not let
her carry my knapsack, gave me a hearty kiss, hoped I
would soon come again and stay a month, bade Röschen
take care of me, and turned away homewards with tears
in her eyes.</p>

<p>I thought to myself, if my gracious masters&mdash;long
may they live!&mdash;did but grant me an uncircumscribed
holiday, I would stay a month now. And would I
not, oh, worthy hearts! strive to repay your hospitality
by lessons to that young daughter of yours, who craves
to learn English as a hungry man for bread. I had no
claim on you: you had never heard of me, and yet
you entertained me as if I had been your son. May the
love that befalls the cheerful giver dwell ever with you!</p>

<p>Röschen knew all the byepaths and little lanes running
through belts of copse, by which, with many a
rise and fall among the hills, we took our way, she all
the time wondering at my pleasurable emotions at
sight of the picturesque cottages and pretty scenery.
To her they were nothing remarkable. By-and-by we
saw Steinschönau on the left, where the surrounding
hamlets buy groceries, hardware, and napery, and resort
at times for a holiday. While skirting it we saw
here and there on a cottage wall bills of the next Sunday's
play. It would be, so states <i>Herr Direktor
Feichtinger</i>, <i>In celebration of the highest delighting occurrence
of the birth of an Imperial Sproutling, with
festive Illumination. First, the Heart-elevating Austrian
Folks-hymn: then Hanns Sachs, Shoemaker and Poet, a</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">192</a></span>
<i>Drama in Four Acts.</i> And he ends with a notification:
<i>Price of Places as always. But to Generosity no Limit
will be set.</i> Röschen promised herself much pleasure
from a sight of the play.</p>

<p>Hayda, though a small town, is a place of much
importance in the glass trade. You hear the noise of
wheels in every house. "None but glass-workers here,"
said the landlord of the inn where we dined. The
repast over, I said good-bye to Röschen, vexed with
myself for having occasioned her so long a walk, and
taking the road which I had left at Markersdorf, stepped
out for the <i>Riesengebirge</i>&mdash;distant a three days' tramp.
The country between teems with manufactures and
population&mdash;a cheerful country, hill and dale, grain,
flax, and fruit-trees, and the people for the most part
good-looking. Their faces are round, but not flat, and
seemed to me to combine some of the best points of the
German and Czech.</p>

<p>You see dye-works and hear looms at Zwickau&mdash;not
the Saxon town we explored a fortnight ago, but a
dull place, with a great dull square; the wooden houses
dingy, the brick houses rough and ragged. Beyond,
we pass strange-looking rocks and short ranges of cliffs,
the castle and grounds owned by Count Clam Gallas,
and so to Gabel, a town which bears a <i>fork</i> in its coat-of-arms;
and is burdened with recollections of disasters from
fire and sword. It has of course a great square, in the
centre of which stands a tall column, surmounted by a
figure of Christ looking towards the domed church.
Its aspect is cheerful, notwithstanding that the old
wooden houses with projecting gables are blackened by
age.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span></p>

<p>Then the road becomes more hilly, and the distance
appears mountainous. We pass a singular mass of
boulders&mdash;huge compressed bladders turned to stone;
and from time to time other strangely formed rocks,
betokening extraordinary geological phenomena, as if
to prepare us for what we shall see a few days hence at
Adersbach.</p>

<p>By-and-by a deep glen, dark with firs above, green
with birches below, into which you descend by long zigzags.
Here among the trees sat a cuckoo, piping his
name loud enough for all that passed to hear. It was
the second time I had heard the gladsome note in
Bohemia: the first was on the White Hill, while walking
into Prague. Broad views, bounded always by
hills, open as you emerge from the last slope, and there
in a hollow lies the little village of Weisskirchen, where
I tarried for the night. The innkeeper calls his house
the <i>Railway Inn</i>, although there is no railway within
half a day's walk, and in matter of diet all he could
offer was smoked sausage&mdash;which is my abomination&mdash;and
bread and butter.</p>

<p>On the way to Reichenberg next morning I saw a
small, tasteful iron crucifix, with a lamp, set up on
a stone pedestal by the wayside, at the cost, so runs the
inscription, of <i>Gottfried Hermann, Bauer in Rosenthal</i>;
and underneath the devout peasant adds a prayer for
the solace of wayfarers:</p>

</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span></p>

<p>At ten o'clock I came to Reichenberg: a town pleasantly
situate on hilly ground, and animated by many
signs of industry. It is the capital of the manufacturing
region, and in importance ranks next to
Prague. In 1848 the German Bohemians, not relishing
the dictatorial tone of the Czechs in the metropolis
and southern parts of the kingdom, made it the seat of
their Reform Committee, and held meetings, in which
speech, intoxicated by sudden, and, as it proved, short-lifed
freedom, mistook words for things, and, before the
mistake was discovered, lay once more fettered&mdash;faster
than ever.</p>

<p>I found out the <i>Bezirksamt</i> at the farther end of the
town, and was there told to go back to the middle, and
get my passport signed at the <i>Magistratur</i>. I had to
wait while four others passed the desk. The first, a
portly gentleman, evidently of some consideration, was
dismissed in half a minute, and treated to a pinch
of snuff by the clerk. The second, a petty trader,
was kept five minutes, and had to tell why he
wished to journey, and what he meant to do. The
third, a peasant, was only released after a cross-examination,
as if he had been a conspirator; and a rigorous
scrutiny of his passport, which occupied a quarter-hour.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
The fourth, a poor woman, as I have before
mentioned, was denied, and went away with tears in
her eyes. Then came my turn.</p>

<p>"Where are you going?"</p>

<p>I had always the same answer: "To the <i>Riesengebirge</i>."</p>

<p>But as no visa could be given for mere mountains, I
named Landeshut, a few miles beyond the frontier, telling
the functionary at the same time that I had no
intention of visiting the town, and should in all probability
not go thither.</p>

<p>Apparently it mattered not, for the visa was made
out and stamped. This done, the clerk took my passport,
and withdrew to an inner room. His brother
clerks in all the offices I had yet entered had done
the same. What did it mean? Is there a secret chamber
where some highest functionary sits with a black list
before him, in which he must search for suspected
names? No one would tell me. After five minutes
the clerk returned, gave me back my passport, but, less
courteous than his fellows, did not wish me a pleasant
journey.</p>

<p>I dined at the <i>Rothen Adler</i>; strolled through the
market-place and the arcades of the old houses on either
side, noting the ways of the crowd who were buying
and selling meal, fruit, and vegetables. Groups of
countrywomen were passing in and out of the church at
the upper end; and countrymen arrived with trains of
bullock-wagons&mdash;the vehicles so disproportionately small
when contrasted with the animals, that you could not
look at them without laughing. However, they carry
away cotton bales and dyestuffs, of which you see good
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
store in the warehouses. You see piles of woollen cloth,
too, and troops of factory-girls going to dinner.</p>

<p>You will tarry awhile to admire the view from the
hill beyond the town, and will, perhaps, think the tall
chimneys rising here and there without the crowding
roofs rather picturesque than otherwise. All around is
hill and dale; the graceful peak of the <i>Jeschken</i>, 3000
feet high, is in sight; and away to the north-east, inviting
you on, rise heaps of blue mountains. And as you
proceed you descend every two or three miles into a
charming little valley, where you see little factories, and
stripes of linen stretched out to bleach on the grassy slopes.
So at Reinowitz; so at Schlag; so at Neudorf; so at
Morchenstern. At Grünheid, where I stayed for a half-hour's
rest, there was a noticeable appearance of cleanliness.
The inn, inviting of aspect, would have satisfied
even a Dutchwoman. While drinking my glass of beer
I had a talk with the hostesses&mdash;two happy-looking
sisters, who presently told me they had a brother in
England, at Oldham, learning how to spin cotton and
manage a factory. Did I know Oldham?&mdash;had I ever
been there?&mdash;could I tell them anything about it?&mdash;and
so forth. Having visited more than once that hard-working
town, I was enabled to gratify their curiosity.
Then they told me of an Englishman who was employed
in a factory about a mile distant. He had been there three
years, yet his manners were so coarse and disagreeable
that no one liked him, although at first many would
have been his friends. He had learned but very little
German, and that of the worst kind, and was over fond
of drinking too much beer. "He has been trying for
some time," they said, "to get a wife; but no woman
will have him. While good Bohemian husbands are to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
be had, who would marry a bad Englishman? And so
now he is going to fetch a wife from his own country."</p>

<p>And then they asked, "Are all Englishmen such as
he?"</p>

<p>Need I record my answer? It enlightened them as
to the real value of the sample they had described, and
made them fully aware that I for one did not regard
Lancashire as England's model county.</p>

<p>More curious rocks as we drop down towards Tannwald&mdash;a
place, as its name indicates, of fir forests. It
lies deep among hills, watered by a stream brawling
along a stony bed, and here and there you see the
weatherbeaten heads of huge boulders peering from
among the trees. The road makes short and frequent
windings by the side of the stream; now skirted by
groves of mountain ash, and slopes red with clustering
loosestrife; now by feathery larches, green and graceful,
contrasting beautifully with the melancholy firs. Then
you pass an enormous spinnery, its thousand spindles
driven by the dashing torrent; and peeping between the
plants and flowers with which nearly every window is
adorned, you see an army of girls within, busy at the
machinery. Another and another spinnery succeeds;
the houses of the masters appear aloft on pleasant sites,
and signs of prosperous trade crowded into the bend
of a narrow valley. In one place you see a broad
alley through the firs to the top of the highest hill, cut
at the masters' cost for the recreation of the workpeople.
Thickly-strewn cottages betoken a numerous population.
"I wish there were more factories," said the landlord
of the <i>Goldene Krone</i>, "for we have people enough&mdash;more
than enough." Every year things got dearer,
greatly to the folks' surprise. Not many months ago a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
traveller has passed through, who told them that things
would never be cheap again; but no one would believe
him. Some of the best spinners could earn from five
to six florins a week: thriftiness, however, was a rare
virtue, and to earn the money easier than to save it.
Perhaps mine host was the man of all others in Tannwald
best able to speak with knowledge on this economical
question.</p>

<p>If so minded, you can travel from Reichenberg to
Tannwald by <i>Stellwagen</i>; beyond, the road becomes
more and more hilly, and worsens off to a stony track
broken with deep ruts. By taking a short cut directly
up the hill you may save a mile or more on the way to
the next village&mdash;Przichowitz; a name that looks unpronounceable.
It is a steep climb for about half an
hour, provoking many a halt, during which you enjoy
the ever-widening view. From the expanse of hill and
dale to the numberless cottages all around you, each
fronted by a fenced flower-garden, and haunted by the
noise of looms, you will find ample occupation for the
eye. And if you wish to observe domestic labour
competing with the factory-units with an organized
multitude&mdash;the opportunity is favourable.</p>

<p>Przichowitz stands on what appears to be the very
top of the hill till you see the wooded eminence, <i>Stephanshöh</i>,
beyond. There are two inns: the <i>Grünen
Baum</i>, with a fourth share of a bedroom; the <i>Gasthaus
zur Stephanshöh</i>, somewhat Czechish in its appointments.
I quartered myself at the latter; and discovered
two redeeming points&mdash;good wine and excellent coffee.</p>

<p>At bedtime the landlord demanded my passport,
with an intimation that he should keep it in his possession
all night. I demurred. He might bring his book
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
and enter my name if he would: as for giving up to
him a document so essential to locomotion anywhere
within sight of the black and yellow stripes, I saw no
reason why I should, and therefore shouldn't.</p>

<p>"But you must."</p>

<p>"But I won't."</p>

<p>"The gendarme will come."</p>

<p>"Let him come. He will find at least one honest
man under your roof."</p>

<p>The hostess came forward and put in her word: the
company present, who were topping-off their three hours'
potation of <i>Einfach</i> with a glass of <i>Schnaps</i>, ceased their
conversation, and put in theirs:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"Wi' tippenny we fear nae evil,</p>
<p>"Wi' usquebaugh we'll face the devil."</p>
</div></div>

<p>the <i>Kellnerinn</i> waiting all the while with my bed-candle
in her hand. Every one, except the serving-maid, who
held her peace, sided with the landlord.</p>

<p>I urged the same reply over and over again, that not
having been asked at any other <i>Wirthshaus</i> to yield possession
of my passport for a night, I could not believe that
any regulation to the contrary prevailed for Przichowitz.</p>

<p>At length the company, as it appeared, having exhausted
their suggestions, the landlord fetched his book,
and had dipped a pen into the inkstand, when two
soldiers, who were eating a supper of sausage, brown
bread and onions, at a table apart, beckoned him, and
whispered something in his ear.</p>

<p>The whisper revived his suspicions, and would have
renewed the altercation; but I took up my knapsack,
asked what was to pay, and declared for a moonlight
walk to Rochlitz.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span></p>

<p>The demonstration made him pause: he opened the
book, dipped the pen once more into the inkstand, and
looked wonderingly at my passport, which I held open
before him. He tried to spell it out; but in vain. The
pen went into the inkstand again; but to no purpose.
He was completely bothered; and at last, putting the pen
in my hand, he said, not now in a peremptory tone&mdash;"Will
you enter your own name, if I let you do it?"</p>

<p>It would have served him right had I refused, and
left the task entirely to him. However, not to be too
hard upon him, I promised not to inscribe Brown, Jones,
or Robinson, and wrote what was required.</p>

<p>Then, looking round on the company, I said: "A
pretty set of cowards you are! Here are nine of ye,
two of them soldiers, and you all take the part of a suspicious
landlord against one&mdash;and that one a foreigner.
No wonder you are all afraid of a gendarme; and submit
to ask leave when you want to go a day's journey.
Try, in future, and remember that honesty does not become
rogue by travelling on foot. Good night!"</p>

<p>"So, now it's settled," said the <i>Kellnerinn</i>, who still
waited with the candle in her hand; and she led the way
up-stairs.</p>

<p>Before sleeping I repented of my speech; for what
could be expected from people who never attended a
vestry meeting&mdash;never saw a general election&mdash;never
exercised the privilege of booting a candidate on the
hustings?</p>

<p>And never had a <i>Times</i> to publish their grievances.

the Clouds.
</p>

<p class="p2">Soon after six the next morning I was on the top of
<i>Stephanshöh</i>&mdash;about twenty minutes' walk from the inn&mdash;prepared
to enjoy the view: and did enjoy all that
was not concealed by mist. Every minute, too, as the
heaving vapour melted away, so did the landscape
widen and rejoice in the sunbeams. We are here on the
roots of the <i>Riesengebirge</i>, and all around is a rolling
country, rising higher and higher towards the north.
Because of the view the height is famous throughout
the neighbourhood; visitors come to it even from
Reichenberg.</p>

<p>While I was drinking my early cup of coffee, the
landlord came forward, made a bow, and expressed his
hope to see me again some day.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span></p>

<p>"Hope not," I replied, "for besides plaguing folk
about their passport, you lodge them between dirty
sheets over an unswept floor. Good morning!"</p>

<p>Beware, reader, of Przichowitz!</p>

<p>The road winding along a hill-side leads you onwards
high above the valleys that open at every bend. After
about an hour it narrows into a footpath, which presently
branches off into many paths down the steep slope
of a secluded vale. A woman of whom I asked the way
shook her head, and answered, "<i>Böhmisch</i>," and to my
surprise I found myself once more among the Czechs.
A Sclavonic wedge, so to speak, here cuts between the
German-speaking population who inhabit the northern
border. With its base in the heart of the kingdom, it
stretches away to the Silesian frontier, traceable for the
most part by the names of numerous villages ending in
<i>witz</i>.</p>

<p>I chose a path for myself which led down between
patches of clover and rye, beetroot and potatoes, through
little orchards, under rows of limes, to a house which, at
a distance, had an imposing, spacious appearance; deceitful
till you come near. The ground stage is nothing
but a rough mass of masonry supporting that which is
really the house&mdash;a low wooden edifice, swarming with
weavers, reared aloft, probably, to keep it out of the
way of floods. As I mounted the rude steps in quest of
information, a weaver opened a casement and put out
his head, letting out, at the same time, a rush of the depraved
air in which he and his mates were working. I
asked the way.</p>

<p>He shook his head, and answered, "<i>Böhmisch</i>."</p>

<p>He did more. He started up from his loom, came
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">203</a></span>
actually forth into the wholesome air, and ran to a cottage
some distance off, making signs to me to wait his
return. He came presently back wearing a triumphant
look, accompanied by another weaver, who could speak
German enough to assure me that I was on the right
track for Rochlitz, and that the mountain stream flowing
so merrily past was the Iser. Poor men! they both
had a pale, sodden look, which moved me to recommend
fresh air and open windows. But no: they shivered,
and could not weave when the windows were open.</p>

<p>A bright stream is the Iser, and plenteous of trout:
a water such as the angler loves, now brawling over
shallows, now sleeping in hazel-fringed pools. You will
pause more than once while climbing the hill beyond to
scan the vale. All the greater slopes are broken up
with lesser undulations&mdash;wherein much is half seen,
and thickly-patched with wood; little cottages nestle
everywhere among the trees, the little chapel near the
summit; and here and there on the outskirts a dark
ridge of firs reminds you of the melancholy miles of
forest beyond. Here, far from great roads, all breathes
of calm and content, all sights and sounds are rural;
you hear the water babbling to the whispering leaves,
and might fancy yourself in the very home of happiness.
But</p>

<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"The statutes of the golden age,</p>
<p class="i1">That lingered faint and long</p>

<p class="i1">At Mammon's shrine to bow;</p>
<p>And many a Tyre our steps may find,</p>
<p class="i1">But no Arcadia now."</p>
</div></div>

<p>With the Iser the Czechs are left behind. While
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
taking leave of the oval-faced people, the opportunity
seems fitting to bring forward a few words of testimony
concerning them, which may be weighed against that
mentioned in a former page. Barrande, the distinguished
geologist, says, in his <i>Silurian System of Bohemia</i>,
that, in 1840, he and his friends commenced
a regular exploration of strata, employing native labourers
in different parts of the country, either singly
making new excavations, or in groups opening quarries.
"These labourers," he continues, "provided with the
necessary tools, and practically instructed by working
with us for some time, soon acquired the knowledge indispensable
for distinguishing every organic trace&mdash;the
objects of our studies&mdash;at the first glance. In this
respect we have often had occasion to admire the intelligence
of the Bohemians (Czechs), even of those belonging
to the humblest class. Some among them employed
in our researches during ten or twelve years
acquired a remarkable skill as seekers of fossils. They
gather up and put together the smallest fragments
which belong to any specimen broken in splitting the
rock; they use a lens to discover the fugitive traces of
the minutest embryo, and they know very well how to
distinguish all rare or new forms in the district to
which they are attached. A sort of nomenclature, improvised
by themselves out of the Bohemian language,
has served us to designate both the species and formations
in which they are found."</p>

<p>Thus, with his rustic Czechs, Mr. Barrande could
carry on investigations at a distance, while in his study
at Prague he prepared his truly great work for publication.
One of the diggers brought in the specimens
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
once a week; and in this way were discovered fifteen
hundred species of what geologists call Silurian and
Cambrian fossils, the existence of which in Bohemia
was before unknown.</p>

<p>It is not far to Rochlitz&mdash;perhaps a mile&mdash;but the
vale is hidden ere you arrive by the shoulder of the hill.
Almost the first house is <i>Gast und Einkehr Haus zur
Linde</i>, and it has a living sign&mdash;a beautiful linden-tree.
Here cleanliness prevails, and the speech is German;
but the room is so hot from the scorching stove, that I
prefer to eat my second breakfast on the grass in the
shadow of the lime, and listen to the busy hum of countless
bees among the branches. The room, however, was
a study&mdash;a sort of museum: racks overhead, three glass
closets, twenty-four pictures, a sofa, a score of daddy-longlegs
chairs, a guitar and fiddle, two beds in view
besides one shut off by a screen, and all the sundries
common to a public-house. But for good housewifery
it would be hideous.</p>

<p>The landlord, a man of friendly speech, came out for
a talk. From his orchard we could look down into a
charming dell: a sylvan retreat, marred, alas! by an offshoot
from Tyre. From among the trees there rose the
tall chimney and staring walls of a factory; and while
we talked, a dozen men went past, each wheeling a
barrow-load of lime, from a distance of two miles, for
the building. Mine host felt glad at the prospect of
work for the people. "We have nine thousand inhabitants
in Rochlitz," he said; "'tis a great place. To
walk through it you must take three hours." And he
pointed out a cliff overlooking a valley where mining
works had just been bought by a Russian for two
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
hundred thousand florins. "Yes, there would be work
enough for the people." Plenty of work at little wages.
A weaver earns one florin twenty-four kreutzers a week,
and the happy few who achieve two florins are regarded
as rich by their neighbours: perhaps with envy and
admiration.</p>

<p>Then he pointed out his own ground, and his forest
run reaching to the very hill-top, all of which had cost
him fifteen thousand florins; and he turned to all quarters
of the compass with the air of a man well pleased with
himself. "Those," he said, stretching his finger towards
a row of short, round, wooden columns with conical
roofs&mdash;"those are my beehives; come and look at
them."</p>

<p>These hives are about four feet high, fixed clear of
the ground by stakes driven through the turf, and are
constructed in compartments one fitting above the other.
The bees begin to work in the lowest, and, when that is
filled, ascend into the upper stories. One among them
seemed deserted.</p>

<p>"Let us see what's the matter," said the landlord; and
he lifted off the top story. Immediately there swarmed
out thousands of earwigs.</p>

<p>"Huhu! that's not the sort of bees we want. Coobiddy,
coobiddy!" And judging from the lusty crow
that followed it, chanticleer and his seraglio must have
had a satisfactory repast.</p>

<p>But <i>Schneekoppe</i> was yet far off, and there was no
time to be lost if I wished to reach that Mont Blanc of
German tourists before night. I inclined to leave the
rough-beaten track through the valleys for short cuts
across the hills, and asked the landlord about a guide.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
His woodcutter, who was splitting logs close by, knew
great part of the way, and was ready to start there and
then and carry my knapsack for a florin. He put a
piece of coarse brown bread into a bag, which he lashed
to one of the straps, and away we went.</p>

<p>"Good-bye!" said the landlord: "a month later and
you would have had company enough; for then students
come in herds to see the mountains."</p>

<p>We struck at once up a grassy hill on the left, and
could soon look down on Rochlitz&mdash;houses scattered
along either side of a narrow road in a deep valley;
and, far in the rear, on Hochstadt, a wee town of great
trade. Then we came to a <i>Jägerhaus</i>, and plunged
into a pine forest, walking for two or three miles
along winding paths, paved with roots, under a solemn
shade where, here and there, sunny gleams sought out
the richest brown of the tall, straight stems, and the
brightest emerald among the patches of damp moss.
At times we came to graceful birches scattered among
the firs, and their drooping branches and silvery boles
looked all the more beautiful amid companions so unbending.</p>

<p>We emerged on a bare, turfy slope, and came presently
to a stony ridge on the right&mdash;the <i>Grünstein</i>&mdash;so named
from a large bright green circle of lichen on the
broken rocks which first catch your eye. A little farther
along the same ridge, and the guide points to a great
ring of stones on the slope as <i>Rübezahl's</i> Rose-garden,
and the name makes you aware that here is the classic
ground of gnomery. You remember the German storybooks
read long ago with delight, wonder, or fear: the
impish pranks, the tricks played upon knaves, the lumps
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
of gold that rewarded virtue; the marvellous world deep
underground, and all the weird romance.</p>

<p>You will perhaps think that imps had a right to be
mischievous in such a region. On the left opens a wild,
dreary expanse of fells&mdash;the coarse brown turf strewn
with hassocks of coarser grass, and pale lumps of quartz
intermingled, and rushy patches of darker hue showing
where the ground is soft and swampy. It has a lifeless
aspect, increased by a few scattered bushes of <i>Knieholz</i>
that look like firs which have stunted themselves in
efforts to grow. Now and then an Alpine lark twitters
and flits past, as if impatient to escape from the cheerless
scene.</p>

<p>We crossed these fells, guided by an irregular line of
posts planted far apart. In places the ground quakes
under your foot, and attempts to cut off curves are
baffled by treacherous sloughs. On you go for nearly
an hour, the view growing wilder, until, in the middle
of a spongy meadow, known as the <i>Naworer Wiese</i>, you
see a spring bubbling up in a circular basin. It is the
source of the Elbe.</p>

<p>Here, 4380 feet above the sea-level, the solitude is
complete. Here you may lie on your back looking up
at the idle clouds, and enjoy the luxury of silence, for
the prattle of the water disturbs it not. You will think
it no loss that nothing now remains of monuments which
the Archdukes Joseph and Rainer once erected here to
commemorate their visit: the lonely scene is better
without them. There are monuments not far off more
to your mind. Towards the south rises the <i>Krkonosch
Berg</i><a name="FNanchor_G" id="FNanchor_G" href="#Footnote_G" class="fnanchor">[G]</a>&mdash;sometimes called the <i>Halsträger</i>&mdash;and <i>Kesselkoppe</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
towards the west; great purple-shaded slopes of
darkest green.</p>

<p>Not often during the summer will you find real solitude,
as we did; for the Germans come in throngs and
sit around the little pool to quaff the sparkling water, or
pour libations of richer liquor. Is not this the birthplace
of the Elbe, the river that carries fatness to many
a broad league of their fatherland, and merchandise to
its marts? Many a merry picnic has <i>Krkonosch</i> witnessed,
and many a burst of sentiment. Hither used to
come in the holidays&mdash;perhaps he comes still&mdash;a certain
rector of a Silesian school with his scholars; and after
their frolics he would teach them that the life of a river
was but the symbol of their own life; and then, after
each one had jumped across the sprightly rivulet, he
bade them remember when in after years they should
be students at Wittenberg, how they had once sprung
from bank to bank of the mighty stream. The Elbe
has, however, two sources: this the most visited. The
other is ten miles distant on the southern slope of
<i>Schneekoppe</i>. They unite their waters in the <i>Elbgrund</i>.</p>

<p>A stream is formed at once by the copious spring.
We followed it down the slope&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"Infant of the weeping hills,</p>
<p>Nursling of the springs and rills"&mdash;</p>
</div></div>

<p>to a rocky gulf, where it leaps a hundred feet into the
precipitous chasm, and chafes onwards in a succession of
cascades far below, gathering strength for its rush through
the mountain barrier&mdash;the Saxon Highlands&mdash;and its
long, lazy course through the plains of Northern Germany.
Here a little shanty is erected, the tenants of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">210</a></span>
which dam the water, and let it loose for its plunge
when tourists arrive who are willing to pay a fee to see
Nature improved on. But you may scramble about the
rocks and down to the noisy influx of the <i>Pantsche
Fall</i> as long as you please, and peep over into the deep
gulf, without any payment.</p>

<p>Then up a steep stony acclivity to a higher elevation,
another of the great steps or terraces which compose the
Bohemian side of the mountains. From the top we
should have seen <i>Schneekoppe</i> himself, had he not been
hidden by clouds; however, we saw a mass of gray
cumulus behind which old Snowhead lurked, and that
was something.</p>

<p>Rougher and rougher grows the way: more and more
of the big boulders lying as if showered down; and here
and there singular piles of rock appear. Some resemble
woolsacks heaped one above another, and flattened; some
a pilastered wall, all splintered and cracked, sunken at
one end; some heathen tombs and imitations of Stonehenge;
and some animal forms hewn by rude people in
the ancient days with but indifferent success. On one,
an experienced guide&mdash;which mine was not&mdash;will show
you the impression of a large hand, and tell you it is
<i>Rübezahl's</i> glove.</p>

<p>The path makes many a jerk and twist among the
rocks; at times through a dense scrub of <i>Knieholz</i>&mdash;a
dwarfish kind of fir, crooked as rams'-horns, peculiar to
these mountains, and, as travellers tell us, to the Carpathians.
To its abundant growth some of the hills owe
their dark green garment. Half an hour of such walking
brought us in sight of <i>Rübezahl's</i> chancel&mdash;walls of
rocks split into horizontal layers&mdash;and strangely piled,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
as if by the hands of crazy Cyclopean builders. A fearsome
place in olden time; now a shelter to the <i>Schneegrubenhaus</i>,
where you will choose to rest and dine before
further exploration.</p>

<p>The house stands on the verge of a mighty precipice,
from which you have a wide view over the most beautiful
and picturesque part of Silesia. It was a glorious
sight, miles of hill and dale, forest and meadow stretching
far away&mdash;yellow and green, and blue and purple&mdash;touched
here and there by flashing lights where the sun
fell on ponds and lakes; villages, seemingly numberless,
basking in the warmth of a July sun. The <i>Hirschbergerthal</i>,
into which we shall travel ere many days be
over, lies outspread beneath as in a map; Warmbrunn,
with its baths in the midst, five hours distant, and yet
apparently so near that you fancy a musket-shot would
break one of the gleaming windows. Although, as
some say, there is a want of water, you will still think
it a view worth climbing the <i>Riesengebirge</i> to see.
"There is only one Silesia!" cried the Great Frederick,
when he looked down upon it from the <i>Landeshuter
Kamm</i>.</p>

<p>Having feasted your eye with the remote, you will
turn to look at the two <i>Schneegruben</i>&mdash;greater and
lesser snow-gulfs. To the right and left the precipice
is split by a frightful chasm a thousand feet deep, between
jagged perpendicular cliffs. Looking cautiously
over the edge, you scan the gloomy abyss where the sun
never shines except for a brief space in the early morn.
You see a chaos of fallen blocks and splinters, where the
winter's snow, often unmelted by the summer rains,
forms miniature glaciers, from one of which the Kochel
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
springs to charm wondering eyes with its fall in the lowlands
by Petersdorf. You see how the jutting crags
threaten to tumble; how the heaps far below are overgrown
by treacherous <i>Knieholz</i>, and form ridges which
dam the sullen waters of two or three small lakes. A
patch of green, a small meadow, smiles up at you from
the lesser gulf; and it surprises you somewhat to be
told that a painstaking peasant makes hay there, by
stacking the grass on high poles, and carries it in winter
when snow enables him to use a sledge.</p>

<p>If sure of foot, you may scramble down the ridge and
look at the cliffs from below, and on the way at a remarkable
geological phenomenon. In the western declivity
the ruddy granite is cut in two by a stratum of
basalt, which broadens as you descend, its surface cut
up by pale gray veins resembling a network. It is said
to be the only instance in Europe of basalt found at such
a height, and in such intimate neighbourhood with
granite. It is laborious walking at the base, and dangerous
where vegetation screens the numerous crevices.
However, if you take pleasure in botany, there are rare
plants to repay the exploit; and if you care only for the
romantic, to have been frowned down upon by the tremendous
cliffs will suffice you.</p>

<p>When you climb back to the summit the host will
ask you to look at his museum, and collection of knick-knacks
for sale&mdash;memorials of the <i>Schneegruben</i>. There
are crystals, and specimens from the neighbouring rocks,
and carvings cut out of the <i>Knieholz</i>, an excellent wood
for the purpose. Among these latter are heads of
<i>Rübezahl</i>, with roguish look and bearded chin, to be
used as whistles, or terminations for mountain-staves.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
Or, if you desire it, he will fire a small mortar to startle
the echoes. You may, however, rouse echoes for yourself
by rolling big stones into the gulf; but beware lest
you meet the fate of Anton, the guide, who, in 1825,
while starting a lump of rock, lost his balance, fell over,
and was dashed to pieces against the crags.</p>

<p>Such cliffs are said to be characteristic of the <i>Riesengebirge</i>.
Another example of a <i>Schneegrube</i> occurs
near Agnetendorf, which is six hundred feet deep. And
close by it is the Wandering Stone, a huge granite block
of thirty tons' weight, which has moved three times
within memory, to the wonder of the neighbourhood.
In 1810 it travelled three hundred feet, in 1822 two
hundred, and in 1848, between the 18th and 19th of
June, about twenty-five paces.</p>

<p>Another characteristic of these mountains, as I discovered,
is that when you have climbed up one of their
great steps or terraces, you have to make a deep descent
on the farther side before coming to the next, whereby
the labour of the ascent is increased. On leaving the
<i>Schneegruben</i>, you traverse a level so thickly strewn
with boulders and rocky fragments that you fancy more
would not lie, till, coming presently to the descent, you
find nothing but stone. In and out, rise and fall; now
a long stride that shakes you rudely; now a cheating
short step&mdash;such is the manner of your going down.
Nothing but stone! the track in many places scarcely
visible though trodden for years. You will think it a
terrible stair before you have finished. Near the foot
we met a party going up, one a lady seated in a <i>Tragsessel</i>&mdash;a
sedan-chair without its case&mdash;carried by two
men. Talk of palanquin-bearers in Hindoostan! their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
work must be play compared with that of these Silesian
chair-carriers. I pitied them as they toiled up the stony
steep, hard to climb with free limbs, much more so with
such a burden; and yet they looked contented enough,
though very damp. We met three more chairs, each
with its lady, in the course of the next two hours.</p>

<p>Nothing has ever realized my idea of utter desolation
so entirely as the sight of that stony steep when I looked
back on it from below. A great rounded hill of stone,
blocks on blocks up-piled to the summit, sullen as despair,
notwithstanding the greenish tinge of clinging
lichen. I wondered whether the accursed hills by the
Dead Sea could look more desolate.</p>

<p>Rough walking now, through straggling <i>Knieholz</i>;
across stony ridges, and past more of the uncouth
piles of rock that look weird-like in the slanting sunbeams.
All at once you hear the noise of a hurdy-gurdy:
a surprise in so deserted a region, and you may
fancy <i>Rübezahl</i> at his pranks again; but presently you
see a beggar squatted in the bush, whose practised ear
having caught the sound of footsteps before you came
in sight, the squeak is set a-going to inspire charity.
And now these musical surprises will beset you every
half-mile&mdash;flageolet, tambourine, clarionet, or fiddle.
Where do the musicians live? No signs of a house are
visible near their lurking-places.</p>

<p>We came to a <i>Baude</i>, a lonely farmstead, with a few
fields around: the dwelling roughly built of wood, without
upper story. Many similar buildings are scattered
among the mountains&mdash;cause of thankfulness to weary
travellers, for the inmates are always ready with rustic
fare and lodging. Here the guide had to ask the way,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
having already come farther than he knew. The path
led us across swampy ground, where you walk for a
mile or two on stepping-stones through open fir woods,
always meeting some group of rocks. Another half-hour,
and we emerged into a little green vale, shut in
by high steep hills and forest, the <i>Spindlerbaude</i> standing
at the upper end. My guide being afraid to venture
farther, I released him, and engaged another; one
in full professional costume&mdash;tall boots, peaked hat, and
embroidered jacket&mdash;who undertook to go the remaining
distance with me for twenty kreutzers. While I drank
a glass of beer, a man and woman made the room ring
again with harp and clarionet.</p>

<p>It was past six when we started, and betook ourselves
at once to the steep ridge behind the <i>Baude</i>. Once up,
we saw <i>Schneekoppe</i> rising as a dark cone in the distance,
and away to the right the <i>Mädelstein</i>, so named
from a shepherdess having been frozen to death while
sheltering under the rock from a snow-storm. On the
Bohemian side, towards the south, the view is confined;
but northwards, over Silesia, it spreads far as eye can
reach, the nearer region in deep shade, for the sun is
dropping low. By-and-by we leave the broken stony
ground for the grassy ridge of the <i>Lahnberg</i>, where the
path skirts a cliff, which, curving round to the right and
left, encloses the <i>Grosser Teich</i>, a black lake, on which
you look down from a height of six hundred feet. The
inky waters fill an oval basin about twenty-four acres in
extent and seventy-five feet deep, and remain quite
barren of fish, although attempts have been made to
stock it with trout. The superflux forms a stream
named the Great Lomnitz.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span></p>

<p>From hence more rock-masses are in sight: the
<i>Mittagstein</i>, so named because the sun stands directly
over it at mid-day, a sign to the haymakers and turf-diggers;
the <i>Dreisteine</i>, fifty feet high, resembling the
ruin of a castle, split into three by a lightning stroke a
hundred years ago; the <i>Katzenschloss</i> (Cat's Castle) and
others, which the guide will tell you owe their names to
<i>Rübezahl</i>.</p>

<p>We cross the <i>Teichfelder</i> and look down on the Little
Pond: a lively sheet of water, for the surface is rippled
by a waterfall that leaps down the precipice, and beneath
trout are numerous as angler can desire. You
will notice something crater-like in the form of the cliffs
of both ponds: no traces of lava are, however, to be
discovered.</p>

<p>We passed the Devil's Gulf, through which flows the
Silver Water, and came to more rough ground, and
scrub, and lurking bagpipers. The veil of twilight was
drawn over Silesia, and the peaks and ridges on the
right loomed large and hazy against the darkening sky.
We came to the <i>Riesenbaude</i> on the edge of the <i>Riesengrund</i>
(Giant's Gulf), from which uprears a steeper
slope than any we had yet encountered.</p>

<p>It is incredibly steep, the path making short zigzags,
as on the Gemmi, fenced by a low wall. On either
side you see nothing but loose slabs of stone, which
must have made the ascent well-nigh impossible to unpractised
feet, before Count Schaffgotsch constructed the
new path at his own cost. A hard pull to finish with.
However, in about twenty minutes we come to a level,
where the wind blows strong and cold, and something
that looks like a house and a circular tower looms
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
through the dusk. The guide steps forward and opens
a door, which admits us to a dim passage. He opens
another door, and I am dazzled by the lights of a large
room, where some forty or fifty guests are sitting at
rows of tables eating, drinking, and smoking, while
three women with harps sing and play in a corner.</p>

<p>To step from the chill gloom outside into such a scene
was a surprise; and after my long day's walk to find a
comfortable sofa five thousand feet above the sea, was a
solace which I knew how to appreciate.

</p>

<p class="p2">Here, on the top of <i>Schneekoppe</i>, you find the appliances
of luxury and elegance as well as of comfort.
Many kinds of provisions, good wine, and beer
of the best. A bazaar of crystals, carvings, <i>Rübezahl's</i>
heads, and mountain-staves. Beds for fifty guests, and
<i>Strohlager</i> (straw-lairs) for fifty more, besides music
and other amusements, make up a total which satisfies
most visitors. Do not, however, expect a room to
yourself, for each chamber contains four beds, in one of
which you will have to sleep or accept the alternative
of straw. I heard no demur to these arrangements: in
fact, most of the guests seemed to like throwing off conventionalities
of the nether world while up among the
clouds. For water&mdash;that is, to drink&mdash;you pay the
price of beer, and with a disadvantage; seeing that,
from being kept in beer-casks, its flavour is beery.</p>

<p>The company, though German, is very mixed: specimens
of the men and women-kind from many parts of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
Germany. Here are Breslauers, who will say <i>cha</i> for <i>ja</i>:
Berliners, who&mdash;cockneys of another sort, give to all
their <i>g</i>'s the sound of <i>y</i>&mdash;converting <i>green</i> into <i>yreen</i>, <i>goose</i>
into <i>yoose</i>: <i>gobble</i> into <i>yobble</i>: Bremeners, whose Low
Dutch has a twang of the Northumbrian burr; besides
Saxons, Hanoverians, Mecklenburgers, and a happy
couple, who told me they came from Gera&mdash;a principality
about the size of Rutlandshire. Flat faces and
round faces are the most numerous. The Silesians
betray themselves by an angular visage and prominent
chin. "Every province in Prussia," says Schulze to
Müller, "has its peculiarity, or property, as they call it.
Thus, for example, Pomerania is renowned for stubbornness;
East Prussia for wit; the Rhineland for uprightness;
Posen for mixed humour; the Saxon for softness;
the Westphalian for hams and <i>Pumpernickel</i>; and Silesia&mdash;for
good-nature." And here, on the highest ground
in all North Germany, you may any day between Midsummer
and Michaelmas bring the humourous philosopher's
observations to the test.</p>

<p>Hilarity prevailed: the songstresses sang their best
and twanged their strings with nimble fingers, and&mdash;came
round with a sheet of music. Then a few of the
guests migrated into the little chambers which on two
sides open from the principal room; then a few more;
and I noticed that some stopped to read a label affixed
to the wall. I did the same. It bore a couplet:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p><i>Wisse nur des Narren Hand</i></p>
<p><i>Malt und schreibt auf Tisch und Wand.</i><a name="FNanchor_H" id="FNanchor_H" href="#Footnote_H" class="fnanchor">[H]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span></p>

<p>Three hairy faces lay fast asleep on their pillows in
the room to which I was shown. The bodies to which
they belonged were covered with coats and wrappers, as
well as blanket, for the night was very cold, and the
wind blew around the house with an intermittent snarl.</p>

<p>I did not rise with the next morning's sun, but two
hours later. By that time the mists had cleared off, or
become so thin as not to conceal the landscape, and, on
going out among the shivering groups, I saw an open
view all round the horizon. The Silesian portion is by
far the most attractive. To the south-west the <i>Jeschken</i>
catches your eye, and, far beyond, the swelling outline of
the <i>Erzgebirge</i>; to the south you see towns and villages
in the valley of the Elbe, and in a favourable atmosphere
the White Hill of Prague: in like circumstances Breslau
can be seen, though forty-five miles distant to the north-east,
and Görlitz with its hill&mdash;<i>Landskrone</i>&mdash;almost as
far to the north-west, and on rare occasions, it is said,
you can see the foremost of the Carpathians.</p>

<p>Not one of the remotest points was visible. I took
pleasure in tracing my yesterday's route, in which the
<i>Schneegruben</i> is all but hidden by an intervening
ridge, and in surveying that which I had now to follow.
There, in the direction towards Breslau, lay Schatzlar,
and the lonely peak of the <i>Zobten</i>&mdash;the navel of Silesia,
as old writers call it; and miles away easterly the <i>Heuscheuer</i>,
a big hill on the Moravian frontier, which
looks down on Adersbach, where we shall sleep to-night,
if all go well. You can see a long stretch of the <i>Isergebirge</i>&mdash;mountains
of the Iser which form part of the
range&mdash;and deep gulfs, and grim rocky slopes, and
pleasant valleys. But it is not the mountain scenery of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Switzerland or Tyrol: you miss the awful precipices,
the gloomy gorges thundering ever with the roar of
waterfalls, the leagues on leagues of crowding hills,
cliffs and forests, rushing higher and higher, till they
front the storm zone with great white slopes and towering
peaks that dazzle your eye when the sun looks at
them. Here no snow remains save one "lazy streak" in
a hollow of the crags on the heights above the <i>Riesengrund</i>.
Imagine Dartmoor heaved up to twice its present
elevation, and your idea of the view from <i>Schneekoppe</i>
will come but little short of the reality.</p>

<p>The summit itself is a stony level, half covered by the
inn, with its appurtenances and the chapel, leaving free
space all round for visitors. Its height is 4965 Prussian
feet above the sea. The boundary line between
Bohemia and Silesia, which follows an irregular course
along the range, crosses it. A chapel, dedicated to St.
Lawrence, was first erected here by Count Leopold von
Schaffgotsch, in 1668-81; but only since 1824 have
Koppe-climbers found a house on the top to yield them
shelter and entertainment. While walking about to get
the view from every side you will not fail to be struck
by the numerous guides in peaked hats, with broad
band and feather, velveteen jackets heavy with buttons
and braid; and not less by their coarse rustic dialect
than by their costume. Extremes meet, and you will
notice much in common, in sound at least, between this
very High Dutch and the Low Dutch from Bremen and
Hamburg.</p>

<p>The afternoon is the best time for the view. The
shadows then fall to the east, as when I saw it yesterday
from the <i>Schneegruben</i>; the sun is behind you, looking
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
aslant into the Silesian vales, searching out whatever
they possess of beautiful, and bringing out the lights on
towns and villages for leagues around.</p>

<p>I had been told more than once while on the way
that the charges on <i>Schneekoppe</i> were "monstrous;"
but my supper, bed, and early cup of coffee with rusks,
cost not more than one florin fifty kreutzers, service
included; a sum by no means unreasonable, especially
when you remember that all the provant has to be carried
up on men's shoulders.</p>

<p>I have always been favoured with fine weather when
among mountains, and here was no exception. The
<i>Riesengebirge</i>, are, however, as much visited by fog,
rain, and mist, as the mountains of Wales. Tourists
come at times even from the shores of the Baltic, and go
back disappointed, through prevalence of clouds and
stormy weather. I heard of a farmer living not farther
off than Schmiedeberg, who had climbed the <i>Koppe</i>
thirteen times to look down on his native land, and
every time he saw nothing but rain. There came one
summer a few weeks of drought; the ground was
parched, and fears were entertained for the crops.
Thereupon the neighbouring farmers assembled, waited
on the persevering mountain-climber, and besought him
to go once more up <i>Schneekoppe</i>.</p>

<p>"Up <i>Schneekoppe</i>! for what?"</p>

<p>"If you do but go, look ye, it will be sure to rain,
and we shall be so thankful."</p>

<p>Soon after six I started for the descent into Silesia,
in company with two young wool-merchants from Breslau.
On this side the slope is easy; but, as on the
other side, after falling for awhile, the path makes a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
rise to pass over <i>Schwarzkoppe</i> (Black Head), a hill
rough with heather. To this succeeded pleasant fir-woods,
then birch and beech, and before eight we came
to <i>Grenzbäuden</i> (frontier-buildings), a place renowned
for its hospitality wherever lives a German who has
seen the mountains. Three houses offer entertainment;
but Hübner's is the most resorted to. There you find
spacious rooms, a billiard-table, a piano, maps on the
walls, and a colonnade for those who prefer the open
air; and sundry appliances by which weather-bound
guests may kill time. But, by common consent, Hübner's
chief claim to consideration is, that Hungarian
wine never fails in his cellar.</p>

<p>"Did you taste the Hungarian wine?" is the question
asked of all who wander to the Giant Mountains.</p>

<p>The two Breslauers were not less ready for breakfast
than myself. We each had a half-bottle of the famous
wine, and truly its reputation is not unmerited. If you
can imagine liquid amber suffused with sunshine, you
will know what its colour is. It looks syrupy, and has
the flavour of a sweet Madeira, not, as it appeared to
me, provocative of a desire for more. Neither of the
Breslauers inclined to try a second half-bottle, notwithstanding
their exuberant praises; but one of them, sitting
down to the piano, broke out with a</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"Vivat vinum Hungaricum"</p>
</div></div>

<p>that made the room echo again. Its price is about
twenty pence a bottle; but once across the boundary
line, and you must pay three shillings. In winter, when
snow lies deep, sledge-parties glide hither from Schmideberg
to drink Hungarian, have a frolic, and then skim
homewards down-hill swift as the wind.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span></p>

<p>I had a talk with <i>Meinherr</i> Hübner about the shortest
way to Schatzlar. To think of going to Adersbach
through Schatzlar was, he assured me, a grand mistake.
The road was very hilly, hard to find, and, under the
most favourable circumstances, I need not look to walk
the distance in less than eighteen hours. My Frankfort
map, with all its imperfections, had not yet misled me:
it showed the route by Schatzlar to be the shortest, and
on that I insisted.</p>

<p>"Take my advice," rejoined Hübner; "it has forty
years' experience to back it. Go down to Hermsdorf,
and from thence through Liebau and Schömberg. That
is the only way possible for you. The other will take
you eighteen hours."</p>

<p>The route suggested was that I hoped to follow on
leaving Adersbach, and to travel twice over the same
ground did not suit my inclination, and it was the
longest. Moreover, I wished to keep within the <i>Schmiedeberger
Kamm</i>; and forty years' experience to the contrary
notwithstanding, I refused to be advised.</p>

<p>I may as well mention at once that by five in the
afternoon of the same day I was in Adersbach.

</p>

<p class="p2">About a musket-shot below the <i>Bäuden</i> stands the
frontier guard-house. The two wool-merchants who
had left Warmbrunn for the ordinary three days' excursion
in the mountains, having no passports to show,
were detained, while I, accredited by seven visas, had
free passage and wishes for a pleasant journey. I took
a road running immediately to the right, and had not
gone far when one of Hübner's men came running
after, and offered to show me the way to Schatzlar for
twenty kreutzers.</p>

<p>"If you mean the road," I answered, "I don't want
you. But if you mean the shortest way, across fields,
through bush, anywhere to save distance, come along."</p>

<p>He hesitated a moment, and came. We scrambled
anywhere; up and down toilsome slopes of ploughed
fields, through scrub and brake. We saw the hamlet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
of Klein Aupa and the Golden Valley on the right.
When, after awhile, <i>Schneekoppe</i> came in sight, it
appeared from this side to be the crest of a long,
gradually-rising earth-wave. After about an hour and
a half of brisk walking, we came to a brow, from which
the ground fell steeply to a homely, straggling village,
embosomed in trees, beneath. "There, that's Schatzlar,"
said Hübner's man, and, pointing to a lane that twisted
down the slope, "that's the way to it."</p>

<p>Hübner's man plays knavish tricks. On descending
into the village I found it to be Kunzendorf: however,
it was on the right way, and another two miles brought
me to Schatzlar, a village of one street, the houses
irregular; high, dark, wooden gables, resting on a low,
whitewashed ground story, lit by shabby little windows.
Here I took a road on the left, leading to Bernsdorf,
from which, as it rises, you can presently look back
upon the striped hill behind Schatzlar, the castle, now
tenanted by the <i>Bezirksrichter</i>, and the beechen woods
where the Bober takes its rise: a stream that flows
northwards and falls into the Oder.</p>

<p>Beech woods adorn this part of the country, and
relieve the dark slopes of firs which here and there
border the landscape; and everywhere you see signs of
careful cultivation. After passing Bernsdorf&mdash;a village
on the high road to Trautenau&mdash;I fell in with a weaver,
and we walked together to Altendorf. A right talkative
fellow did he prove himself; a barefoot philosopher,
clad in a loose garment of coarse baize. He lived at
Kunzendorf, where he kept his loom going while work
was to be had, and, when it wasn't, did the best he
could without. Thought a dollar a week tidy wages;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
a dollar and a half, jolly; and two dollars, wonderfully
happy. Never ate meat; never expected it, and so
didn't fret about it. Bread, soup, and a glass of beer
at the <i>Wirthshaus</i> in the evening, was all he could get,
and a weaver who got that had not much to complain
of. All this was said in a free, hearty tone, that left
me no reason to doubt its sincerity.</p>

<p>The country was no longer what it had been.
Twelve years ago the land to the right and left, all
the way from Schatzlar, was covered with forest; now
it was all fields, and every year the fields spread wider,
and up the hills; and though firewood was dearer,
potatoes, beetroot, and rye were more plentiful; and
that seemed only fair, because every year more mouths
opened and wanted food.</p>

<p>For every cottage we passed my philosopher had
a joke; something about the bees' humming-tops, or
frogs' hams, that sent the inmates into roars of laughter.
I invited him to eat bread and cheese with me at
Altendorf: he stared, gave a whoop of surprise, and
accepted. Of all the large rooms I had yet seen in a
public-house the one in the <i>Wirthshaus</i> here was the
largest; spacious enough for a town-hall. The groined
and vaulted ceiling rests on tall, massive pillars; four
chandeliers hang by long strings; in one corner stands a
two-wheeled truck; an enormous bread-trough; platter-shaped
baskets filled with flour, and a mountain of
washing utensils. Trencher-cap brought us two glasses
of beer&mdash;tall glasses, to match the room, vase-like in
form, and fifteen inches high at least. The beer was of
the colour of porter, and, as I thought, of a very disagreeable
flavour; but the weaver took a hearty pull,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
smacked his lips, and pronounced it better than Bavarian,
or <i>Stohnsdorfer</i>, or any other kind. That was
the sort they always drank at Kunzendorf, and wholesome
stuff it was; meat and drink too. He emptied
my glass after his own&mdash;for one taste was enough for
me&mdash;and then, as he bade me good-bye, and went his
way, he expressed a hope that he might meet with an
Englishman every time he took the same walk.</p>

<p>From Altendorf a short cut by intricate paths over
a wooded hill saves nearly two miles in the distance to
Adersbach. It is a pretty walk, up and down slopes
gay with loosestrife&mdash;<i>Steinrosen</i>, as the country folk call
it&mdash;and among rocks, of which one of the largest is
known as the <i>Gott und Vater Stein</i>. You emerge in
a shallow valley, at Upper Adersbach, and follow the
road downwards, past low-shingled cottages, the fronts
coloured yellow with white stripes, the shutters blue,
and all the rearward portion showing white stripes
along the joints of the old dark wood, and crossing on
the ends of the beams. The eaves are not more than
six feet from the ground, so that where the house
stands back in a garden, it is half buried by apple-trees
and scarlet-runners, and the cabbages and flowers
look in at the windows. The people are as rustic as
their dwellings. Ask a question, and a blunt "<i>Was?</i>"
is the first word in answer; no "<i>Wie meinen sie?</i>" as in
other places. Good Papists, nevertheless, for they stop
and recite a prayer before one of the gaudy crucifixes,
which, surrounded by angels bearing inscribed tablets,
or ornamented by pictures of the Virgin and St. Anne,
stand within a wooden fence at the roadside here and
there along the village.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span></p>

<p>The valley narrows, and presently you see strange
masses of stone peering from the fir-wood on the right,
more and more numerous, till at length the rock prevails,
and the trees grow only in gaps and clefts. The
masses present astonishing varieties of the columnar
form, some tall and upright, others broken and leaning;
and looking across the intervening breadth of meadow,
you can imagine doorways, porticos, colonnades, and
grotesque sculptures. Here and there, fronting the
rest, stands a semicircular mass, as it were a huge
grindstone, one half buried in the earth, or a pile that
looks like a weatherbeaten, buttressed wall; and, raised
by the slope of the ground, you see the tops of other
masses, continuing away to the rear.</p>

<p>The spectacle grows yet more striking, for the height
and dimensions of the rocks increase as you advance.
About a mile onwards and a short range of similar
rocks appears isolated in a wood on the left. Here a
whitewashed gateway bestrides the road&mdash;the entrance
to the <i>Gasthaus zur Felsenstadt</i> (Rock-City Inn), resorted
to every year by hundreds of visitors.</p>

<p>Old Hübner was clearly mistaken. In seven hours
of easy walking I had accomplished the distance from
Grenzbäuden, and was ready, after half an hour's rest,
to explore the wonders of Adersbach.</p>

<p>The custom of the place is, that you shall take a guide
whether or no, pay him a fee for his trouble, and another
for admission besides; and to carry it out, a staff of
guides are always at the service of visitors. Their costume
is the same as that of the mountain guides&mdash;boots,
buttons, hat and feather, and velveteen. You
may wait and join a party if you like: I preferred
going alone.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span></p>

<p>The meadow behind the house is planted with trees
forming shady walks. Here the guide calls your attention
to two outlying masses, one of which he names
<i>Rubezahl</i>, the other the Sleeping Woman. He talks
naturally when he talks, but when he describes or
names anything he does it in the showman's style&mdash;"Look
to the left and there you see Admiral Lyons
a-bombardin' of Sebastopol," &amp;c.; and so frequent and
sudden were these changes of voice and manner, that at
last I could not help laughing at them, even in places
where laughter was by no means appropriate. We
crossed the brook&mdash;<i>Adersbach</i>&mdash;to an opening about
forty feet broad, which forms an approach to the Rock
City that makes a deep impression on you, and excites
your expectations. It is an avenue bordered on either
side by the remains of such buildings and monuments
as we saw specimens of in the mountains on our way
hither, only here the Cyclopean architects worked on a
greater scale, and crowded their edifices together. Here,
indeed, was their metropolis; and this the grand entrance,
where now vegetation clothes the ruin with
beauty.</p>

<p>The road is soft and sandy: everywhere nothing but
sand underfoot. The objects increase in magnitude as
we proceed. Great masses of cliff look down on us,
their sides and summit clothed with young trees&mdash;beech,
birch, fir, growing from every crevice. The sand
accumulated round their base forms a broad, sloping
plinth, overgrown with long grass, creeping weeds, and
bushes, through which run little paths leading to
caverns, vaults, and passages in the rock. Some of the
caverns are formed by great fragments fallen one against
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
the other; some in the solid rock have the smooth and
worn appearance produced by the action of the water,
as in cliffs on the sea-shore; the galleries and passages
are similarly formed; but here and there you see that
the mighty rock has been split from head to foot by
some shock which separated the halves but a few inches,
leaving evidence of their former union in the corresponding
inequalities of the broken surfaces.</p>

<p>Presently we step forth into a meadow from which a
stripe of open country undulates away between the
bordering forest. Here, where the path turns to the
left, you see the Sugarloaf, a huge detached rock some
eighty feet high, rising out of a pond. Either it is an
inverted sugarloaf, or you may believe that the base is
being gradually dissolved by the water. Here, contrasted
with the smooth green surface, you can note the
abrupt outline of the rocks and its similarity to that of a
line of sea-cliffs. Here are capes, headlands, spits, bays,
coves, basins, and outlying rocks, reefs, and islets; but
with the difference that here every crevice is full of
trees and foliage, and branches overtop the crests of the
loftiest.</p>

<p>As yet we have seen but a suburb; now, having
crossed the meadow, we enter the main city of the
rocky labyrinth, and the guide, ever with theatrical
tone and attitude, sets to work in earnest. He points
out the Pulpit, the Twins, the Giant's Glove, the
Chimney, the Gallows, the Burgomaster's Head; and
bids you note that the latter wears a periwig, and has a
snub nose. Some of these are close to the path, others
distant, and only to be seen through the openings, or
over the top of the nearer masses. The resemblance to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
a human head is remarkably frequent, always at the top
of a column. I discovered Lord Brougham's profile,
and advised the guide to remember it for the benefit of
future visitors.</p>

<p>Now the rocks are higher; they crowd close on the
path, and presently we come to a narrow passage
through a tremendous cliff, where further progress is
barred by a door. And here you discover the use of
the guide. Before unlocking, he holds out his hand for
the twenty-kreutzer fee, which every one must pay for
admittance; his own fee will be an after consideration.
He then shows you the figure of a Whale in the face of
the cliff on the left, then you cross the wooden bridge,
and are locked in, as before you were locked out.
There is, however, a free way through the water. The
little brook that flows so prettily by the side of the path
out to the entrance, comes through a vault in the cliff,
about thirty yards, and by stooping you can see the
glimmer of light from the far end. Three women came
that way with bundles of firewood on their backs, and
they wade it every time they go in quest of fuel. The
water is less than a foot in depth.</p>

<p>The passage is narrow and gloomy between the cliffs.
As we emerge, the guide, pointing to a tall rock two
hundred and fifty feet in height, names it the Elizabeth
Tower of Breslau. Then comes the Breslau Wool-market,
from a fancied resemblance in the surrounding
rocks to woolsacks. Not far off are the Tables of Moses,
the Shameless Maiden, St. John the Baptist, the Tiger's
Snout, the Backbone, a long broken column, which
forms a disjointed vertebræ. A long list of names
might be given were it desirable. For the most part the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
resemblances are not at all fanciful; in some instances so
complete, that you can scarcely believe the handiwork
to be Nature's own. She was, however, sole artificer.</p>

<p>We come to a small grassy oasis, where a damsel
offers you a goblet of water from the Silver Spring,
and invites you to buy crystals or cakes at her stall.
The guide shows you the Little Waterfall, a feeder of
the brook struggling in a crevice, and conducts you by
a steep, rocky path to a cavern into which the Great
Waterfall tumbles from a height of about sixty feet.
The rocky sides converge as they rise, and leave an
opening of a few feet at the apex through which the
water falls into a shallow pool beneath. The margin of
this pool, a narrow ledge, is the standing-place.</p>

<p>The quantity of water is not great, but it makes a
pretty cascade down the rugged side of the darksome
cavern. After you have looked at it for a minute or
two, the guide blows a shrill whistle, and before you
have time to ask what it means, the gloom is suddenly
deepened. You look up in surprise. The mouth of
the cavern is entirely filled by a torrent which in
another second will be down upon your head. You
cannot start back if you would; the rock prevents, and
in an instant you see that the water makes its plunge
with scarcely a splash on the brim of the pool.</p>

<p>Artificial improvement of waterfalls affords me but
little pleasure. Here, however, the effect was so surprising
that, as the water gleamed and danced in the
dusky cavern, and the rushing roar and rapid gurgle at
the outlet filled the place with loud reverberations, and
the light spray imparted a sense of coolness, I was
made to feel there might be an exception.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span></p>

<p>In our further wanderings we met sundry parties of
visitors all led by guides who had the same theatrical
trick as mine. You return by the same way to the
locked door; but explorations are being made to discover
a new route among objects sufficiently striking.
Outside the door all is free, and you may roam and
make discoveries at pleasure. There are steep gullies
which lead into very wild places, where for want of
bridges, galleries, and beaten paths, the labour and fatigue
of exploration are sensibly multiplied.</p>

<p>In June, 1844, as inscribed on one of the stones, a
waterspout burst over Adersbach, and flooded all the
tortuous ways among the rocks to a depth of nine feet.
Another inscription records the escape of two Englishmen
in 1709. They were sheltering from a thunderstorm,
when the rock under which they stood was
struck by lightning, and the summit shattered without
their receiving harm from the falling lumps. Inscriptions
of another sort abound&mdash;the initials, or entire
name and address, of hundreds of visitors, who with
chisel or black paint have thought it worth while to let
posterity know of their visit to Adersbach. Some ambitious
beyond the ordinary, have climbed up thirty or
forty feet to carve the capital letters.

<h2>CHAPTER XXIII.</h2>

<p class="hanging">
The Echo&mdash;Wonderful Orchestra&mdash;Magical Music&mdash;A <i>Feu de joie</i>&mdash;The

Guide&mdash;Exploring the Labyrinth&mdash;Curious Discoveries&mdash;Speculations

</p>

<p class="p2">"Will it please you to walk to the echo?" asks the
guide, when we come back to the meadow. And if
you assent&mdash;as every one does&mdash;he turns to the left and
leads you up the open ground above-mentioned to a
small temple&mdash;the Echo House. You see a man standing
near the house playing a clarionet, pausing now
and then to recite; but no answering note or word do
you hear. But take your seat on the bench against that
perpendicular rock on his right, and immediately you
hear a whole orchestra of wind instruments among the
rocks. Such delicious music! Soft, wild, warbling,
rising and falling, melting one into the other in a way
that you fancy could only be accomplished by a band
of Kobolds with <i>Rübezahl</i> for a leader. And when
the player blows short phrases with pauses between,
what mocking sprite is that who imitates the sound,
flitting from crevice to crevice repeating the tones over
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
and over again, fainter and fainter, till they seem not
to die away, but to float out of hearing?</p>

<p>Then his companion comes forward and fires a gun,
a signal, so you might believe, for a great discharge of
musketry among the rocks, platoon after platoon firing
a <i>feu de joie</i>. One&mdash;two&mdash;three&mdash;four! The two men
hold up their hands to signify&mdash;Listen yet! then comes
the rattle of the fifth round from the short range of
rocks which we saw on the left while coming down the
valley; and the firing commenced by the troops in
camp is ended by the outposts.</p>

<p>Then one of the men makes a short oration about the
wonders here grouped by which Nature attracts man
from afar and fills him with joy and astonishment;
voices repeat the oration among the rocks, and then&mdash;he
comes to you for his fee. For the gunshot the tax is
eight kreutzers; and if you give eight more for the
music and oration, the two echo-keepers will not look
unhappy.</p>

<p>And now, if still incredulous, you may talk to the
echo yourself. My test was perfectly convincing, for it
woke up a dozen cuckoos among the rocks. When
Schulze, the humourist already mentioned, was here,
he questioned the mysterious voice concerning political
matters, and got unhesitating answers. For example:</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<img src="images/i_252.jpg" width="560" height="358" alt="" />
</div>
<div class="poetry-container p2">
<div class="poem">
<p class="center"><i>Philosopher.</i></p>
<p class="center"><i>Echo.</i></p>
<p>"Wie steht's um Hellas?</p>
<p class="i1">Helas! Helas! Helas!</p>
<p>Wat hältst du von Russels Worte?</p>
<p class="i1">Worte! Worte! Worte!</p>
<p>Wat fehlt in Hessen?</p>
<p class="i1">  Essen! Essen! Essen!</p>
<p>Was möchten gern die Wallachen?</p>
<p class="i1">  Lachen! lachen! lachen!</p>
<p>Fließt dort (in Russia) nicht Milch und Honig?</p>
<p class="i1">  Jo nich! jo nich! jo nich!</p>
<p>Wann kommt Deutschland zur Harmonie?</p>
<p class="i1">  O nie! O nie! O nie!</p>
<p>Es fehlt ja man eene Kleinigkeit?</p>
<p class="i1">  Einigkeit! Einigkeit! Einigkeit!"</p>
</div></div>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span></p>

<p>Unluckily, the points would all become blunt if
translated; I am constrained, therefore, to leave them
in the original.</p>

<p>My guide waited to be "satisfied." I asked him
what amount of fee he usually received?</p>

<p>"Sometimes," he answered, "I get a dollar."</p>

<p>"But commonly not more than ten kreutzers?"</p>

<p>"<i>M&mdash;m&mdash;ja</i>, that is true."</p>

<p>"Then what would you say to fifteen kreutzers?"</p>

<p>"Sir, I would say that I wish such as you would
come every day to Adersbach."</p>

<p>He left me fully "satisfied." And so, reader, you see
that the picturesque is burdened with a tariff in Bohemia
as it is in certain parts of England, Scotland, and
Wales.</p>

<p>I went back to the rocks. The locked door does not
shut in all the wonders, and there are miles which you
may explore freely. But unless you stick a branch
here and there into the sand, or "blaze" the trees, you
will never find your way out again. The great height
of the rocks surprises you not less than their amazing
number. They are intersected by blind alleys, open
alleys, and lanes innumerable, intertwisting and crossing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
in all directions. Many a cavern, den, and grotto will
you see, and many a delightful sylvan retreat, where
the solitude is perfect; many a bower which is presently
lost. Now you are overcome by wonder, now
by awe, for thoughts will come to you of great rock
cities and temples smitten by judgments; of the giant
race that warred with the gods and were slain by thunder-bolts;
of those who worshipped stones and burnt
sacrifice on the loftiest rocks.</p>

<p>A few paces farther, and seeing how tall trees grow
everywhere among the stony masses, how smaller trees
and shrubs shoot from the crevices, and moss enwraps
pillar and buttress, and fringes the cliffs, you will think
of Nature's silent revolutions; of the ages that rolled
away while the labyrinth of Adersbach was formed.
Here, so say the geologists, currents of water running
for innumerable years, have worn out channels in the
softer parts of a wide stratum of sandstone, and produced
the effects we now witness. The stratum must
have been great, for the rocks extend, more or less
crowded, away to the <i>Heuscheuer</i>, a distance of three
or four leagues. The mountain itself presents similar
phenomena even on its summit.</p>

<p>A supposition prevails, based on much observation,
that the whole of Bohemia was once covered by a vast
lake, or inland sea. The conformation of the country,
its ring-fence of mountains&mdash;whence the term <i>Kessel
Land</i> (Kettle Land) among the Germans&mdash;broken only
where the Elbe flows out, while almost every stream
within the territory finds its way into that river, besides
the fossil deposits so abundantly met with, are facts urged
by the learned in favour of their views. It may have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">239</a></span>
been during the existence of this great sea that the rocks
were formed.</p>

<p>It might be interesting to inquire whether the rocky
labyrinth at Torcal, not far from Antequera, in Spain,
presents phenomena similar to those of Adersbach. The
rocks, as I have read, are of marble, covering a great
extent of ground in groupings singularly picturesque.</p>

<p>It was dusk when I had finished my prowl, for such
it was, accompanied by much scrambling. Then I
climbed to the top of one of the outlying crags for a
view across the maze, and when I saw the numerous
gray heads peering out from the feathery fir-tops, here
and there a bastion, a broken pillar, and weather-stained
tower, the fancy once more possessed me that here was
a city of the giants&mdash;its walls thrown down, its buildings
destroyed, and its rebellious inhabitants turned to stone.</p>

<p>Gradually the hoary rocks looked spectral-like, for
the dusk increased, the clouds gathered heavily, and rain
began to fall. I walked back to the inn, feeling deeply
the force of the Ettrick Shepherd's words, "After a',
what is any description by us puir creturs o' the works
o' the great God?"
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span></p>

</p>

<p class="p2">As <i>Grenzbäuden</i> is renowned for Hungarian wine, so
is Adersbach for baked chickens, and every guest, unless
he be a greenhorn, eats two for supper. They are very
relishing, and quite small enough to prevent any breach
of your moderate habit.</p>

<p>Visitors were numerous: some reading their guide-books,
some beginning supper, some finishing, some
rounding up the evening with another bottle&mdash;for Hungarian
is to be had in Adersbach. A party near me sat
discussing with much animation the demerits of the
taxes which impoverish, and of the beggars who importune,
travellers around the City of the Rocks, and they
drew an inference that the landlord's charges would
not be parsimonious. Then they wandered off into the
question of temperature&mdash;the temperature of <i>Schneekoppe</i>.
Not one of them had yet trodden old Snowhead,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
so they went on guessing at the question, till I
mentioned that it had been very cold up there in the
morning.</p>

<p>"In the morning! This morning? <i>Heut</i>, mean
you?"</p>

<p>"Yes, this very morning; for I was up there."</p>

<p>"<i>Heut! Heut! Heut! Heut!</i>" ejaculated one after
another, the last apparently more surprised than the
first.</p>

<p>"Yes, this very day."</p>

<p>They would not believe it. I took up a sprig of
heather from the side of my plate, which I had gathered
on <i>Schwarzkoppe</i>, and showed them that as a token;
and explained that the distance was, after all, not so very
great, and might have been shortened had I descended
directly from the <i>Koppe</i> into the <i>Riesengrund</i>, and laid
my course through the village of Dorngrund.</p>

<p>They believed then; but having travelled the road
prescribed to me by Father Hübner, could not imagine
the distance from the mountain to be but about twenty
miles.</p>

<p>By rising early the next morning, when all was bright
and fresh and the dust laid by the night's rain, I got
time for another stroll among the rocks, and to walk two
miles farther down the valley to Weckelsdorf, where
another part of the rocky labyrinth is explorable. The
rocks here are on a greater scale than at Adersbach, and
rising on the slope of a hill, their romantic effect is increased,
as also the difficulty of wandering among them.
The proprietor, Count von Nummerskirch, has, however,
taken pains to render them accessible by bridges,
galleries, and stairs. A sitting figure, whose head-dress
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
resembles that of the maidens of Braunau, is named the
Bride of Braunau; near her is the Stone of Tears; the
<i>Todtengasse</i> (Death's Alley) is never illumined by a ray
of sunshine; there is the Cathedral, and near it Diana's
Bath; and at last the Minster, a natural temple, the roof
a lofty pointed arch, where, while you walk up and
down in the dim light, an organ fills the place with
a burst of sound. It is sometimes called the Mint,
or Money Church, because of a gang of coiners having
once made it their head-quarters. The rocks have been
a hiding-place for others as well as rogues. During the
Hussite wars, many families found a refuge within their
intricate recesses, little liable to a surprise, at a time
when entrance was hardly possible owing to the numerous
obstructions.</p>

<p>As at Adersbach, there is a fee to pay for unlocking
a door; there is an echo which answers the guide's
voice, his pistol and horn, and has to be paid for.
Nevertheless, you will neither regret the outlay of time
and kreutzers in your visit to Weckelsdorf. If able to
prolong your stay, you may take an excursion of a few
hours to the <i>Heuscheuer</i>, and see a smaller Adersbach
on its very summit&mdash;the highest of these extraordinary
rock-formations. Or there is the ruin of Bischoffstein,
within an easy walk, once the stronghold of the Bohdanetski
family, who held half a score of castles around
the neighbourhood, and made themselves obnoxious by
their Protestantism and robberies, and envied for their
wealth. They suffered at times by siege and onslaught
from their neighbours, and at length their castles were
demolished, and forty-seven Bohdanetskis and adherents
were hanged by the emperor's command. The
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
rest of the family, it is said, took flight, and settled in
England. Is Baddenskey, who sits wearily at his loom
down there in joyless Spitalfields, a descendant?</p>

<p>I returned to the <i>Felsenstadt</i> for my knapsack. For
supper, bed, and breakfast the charge was equal to three
and threepence, in which was included an extra fifteen
kreutzers for the bedroom, which I had insisted on
having all to myself. When guests are very numerous
they have to sleep four in a room. Take your change
in Prussian money, for "<i>Kaiserliches geld</i>," as the folk
here call it&mdash;that is, imperial money&mdash;will not be current
where you stop to dine.</p>

<p>I retraced my steps for about a mile along the road
by which I came yesterday, and at the church took a
road branching off to the right. It leads through Ober
Adersbach. The villagers were going to church: the
men wearing tall polished boots and jackets, the women
with their heads ungracefully muffled in red, blue,
green, or yellow kerchiefs, and displaying broad, showy
skirts and aprons, and clean white stockings. Now and
then came an exception: a man in a light-blue jacket,
and loose, baggy breeches; a woman with a stiff-starched
head-dress, not unlike those worn in Normandy.</p>

<p>The road continually rises, and by-and-by you cannot
tell the main track from the byeways among the
cottages. Still ascending, however, you come out a
short distance farther on the brow of a precipitous
hill, where you are agreeably surprised by another
Silesian view&mdash;broad, rolling fields of good red land,
bearing vetches, clover, flax, and barley, the little town
of Schömberg in their midst, and always hills on the
horizon. From the brow, a deep lane and a path
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
through the fir-wood on the cliffy hill-side, lead you
down to the road where finger-posts, painted black and
white, indicate that we have exchanged the Austrian
eagle for the Prussian. I must have crossed the frontier
two or three times yesterday and to-day, but I saw
no custom-house anywhere, and no guards, except at
<i>Grenzbäuden</i>.</p>

<p>Other signs showed me on nearing Schömberg that I
had left Bohemia. The men are tall, of sallow complexion,
and angular face. They wear long dark-blue
coats and boots up to their knees, and stiff blue caps
with a broad crown, and they carry pink or blue umbrellas.
The women wear the same colour, and do not
look attractive; and there is an <i>Evangelische Kirche</i>,
in which the preaching is of Protestant faith and doctrine.</p>

<p>The town has two thousand inhabitants, some of
whom dwell in houses that are a pleasure to look upon,
around the market-place. The gables&mdash;no two alike&mdash;are
painted pale green, white, gray, or yellow, and what
with the ornaments, the broken outlines, and arcades of
wood and brick, the great square makes up a better
picture than is to be seen in many a famous city. Although
Sunday, the mill turned by the Kratzbach clacks
briskly; there are stalls of fruit, bread, and toys under
the arcades, and by the side of two or three wagons in
the centre a group of blue-coated men. They look
sedate, and talk very quietly, as if they felt the day
were not for work.</p>

<p>From hence the road, planted with beeches, limes,
and mountain-ash, leads across well-cultivated fields, and
between wooded slopes of the Ueberschar hills to Ullersdorf,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
where <i>Schneekoppe</i> is seen peeping over a dark
ridge on the left. I asked one of the weavers who
inhabit here if he earned two dollars a week.</p>

<p>"<i>Gott bewahr!</i>" he exclaimed, opening his eyes and
holding up his hands apparently in utter amazement,
"that would be too gladsome (<i>frolich</i>). No; I can be
thankful for one dollar."</p>

<p>Content with one dollar a week, which means a perpetual
diet of rye bread and potatoes.</p>

<p>Liebau and Schömberg, about five miles apart, are in
many respects twin towns. If Liebau has not a strikingly
picturesque market-place, nor a reputation for
<i>Knackwürsten</i> (smoked sausage), it has a new Protestant
church, some good paintings in the Romish
church, and a <i>Kreuzberg</i>, once the resort of thousands
of pilgrims. The neighbouring <i>Tartarnberg</i> was, according
to tradition, the site of a Tartar camp in 1241.
Rusty, half-decayed horseshoes and arrow-heads are
still found at times upon it.</p>

<p>After dining at the <i>Sonne</i>, I bought a dessert at a
stall under the arcade: the woman gave me nearly a
gallon of cherries for three-halfpence, with which I
started for Schmiedeberg, ten miles farther. Numbers
of villagers were walking on the road, all the women
bedecked with pink aprons, and looking healthy and
happy. Perhaps out of twenty or more chubby-faced
children, who manifested a lively appetite for fruit, two
or three will remember that they met a strange man
who gave them a handful of cherries, and how that
their mothers became all of a sudden eloquent with
thanks, and bade them kiss their hands, and do something
pretty. Unluckily, by the time I had gone two
miles there was an end of the cherries.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span></p>

<p>The road runs between the <i>Schmiedeberger Kamm</i>
and the <i>Landeshuter Kamm</i>. The main road, which
crosses the latter from Schmiedeberg to Landeshut, is
called the Prussian or Silesian Simplon, for it is the
highest macadamized road in Prussia, its summit being
at an elevation of more than 2200 feet. Extra horses
are required to pass it; and the saying goes that millions
of dollars have been paid on a stone at the top, known
as the <i>Vorspannsteine</i>.</p>

<p>Among rural objects you see huge barns; a tiled roof
resting on tall, square pillars of brick, the intervals between
which are boarded. And here and there a farm,
with all the homestead enclosed by a high whitewashed
wall, which has two arched entrances. The cottages
are low, their roofs a combination of thatch and shingle,
their shutters an exhibition of rustic art, bright red,
with an ornamental wreath in the centre of the panels;
and the wooden column, on which a saint stands by the
wayside, displays a flowery spiral on a ground of lively
green. To a man who was leaning over his gate, I
said that it was very stupid to mar the effect of such
artistic decorations by a slushy midden at the front
door.</p>

<p>"We don't think so: we are used to it," was his
answer.</p>

<p>Now and then you meet a little low wagon, the tilt-hoops
painted blue, and the harness glittering with
numerous rings and small round plates of brass. In the
village of Buchwald the mill was at work, and the men
were busy at the grindstone grinding their scythe-blades
in readiness for the morrow. Here we come upon the
Bober, grown to a lively stream, running along the
edge of the far-spreading meadows on the left. About
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
half a mile farther a wagon-track slants off to the right,
making a short cut over the <i>Kamm</i> to Schmiedeberg.
It leads you by pleasant ways along hill-sides, across
fields and meadows, into lonely vales and solitary lanes,
that end on shaggy heather slopes. To me the walk
was delightful, for uninterrupted sunshine, a merry
breeze, and rural peace, favourable to the luxury of
idle thought, lent a charm to pretty scenery.</p>

<p>From Dittersbach the road ascends the <i>Passberg</i>,
which, on the farther side, sends down a steep descent
to Schmiedeberg. The town lies in a deep valley, and
is so long from one extremity of its scattered outskirts
to the other that you will be nearly an hour in walking
through it, while, for the most part, it is little more
than one street in width. It has an ancient look, and,
owing to the many gardens and bleaching-grounds
among the houses, combines country with town. The
<i>Rathhaus</i> is a fine specimen of tasteful architecture.</p>

<p>From working in iron, the Schmiedebergers have
turned to the making of shawls and plush, and the
entertainment of holiday travellers. The iron trade
began in an adventure on the <i>Riesengebirge</i>. Two
men were crossing the mountains, when one, whose
shoes were thickly nailed, found himself suddenly held
fast on the stony path, unable to advance or return.
He shook with terror. What else could it be than
a spell thrown over him by <i>Rübezahl</i>? At length, by
the other's assistance, he broke the spell; and the two
having brought away with them the stone of detention,
it was recognised as magnetic iron stone; and already,
in the twelfth century, iron works were established,
around which Schmiedeberg grew into a town. It now
numbers four thousand inhabitants.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span></p>

<p>Hither come tourists from far to see the mountains;
and during your half hour's rest at the <i>Schwarzes Ross</i>,
you will be amused by witnessing the eager manifestations
of the newly-arrived, their exuberant gestures
while bargaining with a guide, and the liberal way&mdash;the
bargain once made&mdash;in which they load him with
rugs, cloaks, coats, caps, bonnets, bags, bundles, umbrellas,
parasols, and other travelling gear, until he
carries a mountain on his own shoulders. Besides the
trip to <i>Schneekoppe</i>, some mount to the great beech-tree
and the <i>Friesenstein</i>, on the <i>Landeshuter Kamm</i>;
or visit the laboratories at Krummhübel, where liqueurs,
oils, and essences, are distilled and prepared from native
plants: chemical operations first set on foot in 1700 by
a few students of medicine who fled from Prague to
escape the consequences of a duel. And some go beyond
Krummhübel to look at Wolfshau, a place in the entrance
of the <i>Melzergrund</i>, so shut in by wooded hills
that it never sees the sun during December. And some
to the village of Steinseifen, where, among iron-workers
and herbalists, dwell skilful wood-carvers; one of whom
for a small fee exhibits a large model of the <i>Riesengebirge</i>&mdash;a
specimen of his own handiwork.</p>

<p>On the left, as you leave Schmiedeberg, is the Ruheberg,
a small castle standing in a bosky park belonging
to a Polish prince, where the townsfolk find pleasant
walks. Two miles farther, and the leafy slopes of Buchwald
appear on the right, embowering another castle,
and a park laid out in the English style, and with such
advantages of position, among which are fifty-four
ponds, that it has become an elysium for the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>Once clear of the town, and the mountain-range
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
opens on the left&mdash;rounded heights, ridges, scars, and
peaks stretching away for miles on either side of the
<i>Koppe</i>. Another hour, and turning from the main
road which runs on to Hirschberg, you see houses
scattered about the plain, built in the Alpine style,
with outside stair and galleries, and broad eaves. We
are in the village of Erdmannsdorf&mdash;the asylum granted
by the King of Prussia to about a hundred Tyrolese
families, who, in 1838, had to quit their native country
for conscience' sake. They were Protestants hated by
their bigoted neighbours, and disliked by the priests;
and so became exiles. Nowhere else in Prussia could
they have seen mountains at all approaching in grandeur
those which look down on their native valley, and
yet they must at first have deeply mourned the difference.</p>

<p>Remembering my former year's experiences, I wished
to find myself once more among the Tyrolese. True
enough, there they were in their picturesque costume,
in striking contrast with the Silesians; but there was a
degenerate look about the <i>Wirthshaus</i>, as if they had
forgotten their original cleanliness, which repelled me,
and I went on to the <i>Schweizerhaus</i>, a large inn near
the royal <i>Schloss</i>. As usual, it was overfull, so great is
the throng of visitors, and I had to try in another
direction, which brought me to the <i>Gasthof und Gerichtskretscham</i>,
where the landlord promised me a bed
if I would not mind sleeping in the billiard-room.

<h2>CHAPTER XXV.</h2>

<p class="hanging">
Schnaps and Sausage&mdash;Dresdener upon Berliners&mdash;The Prince's Castle at
Fischbach&mdash;A Home for the Princess Royal&mdash;Is the Marriage Popular?&mdash;View
from the Tower&mdash;Tradition of the Golden Donkey&mdash;Royal

</p>

<p class="p2">At Fischbach, in a pleasant valley, about an hour's
walk from Erdmannsdorf, stands a castle belonging to
Prince Wilhelm of Prussia, which is shown to curious
tourists. A Dresdener, who thought it worth the
trouble of the walk, asked me to accompany him next
morning, and we started after an early breakfast. Early
as it was a party of Silesian peasants were breaking their
fast with <i>Schnaps</i>, sausage, and rye bread. Think of
<i>Schnaps</i> and sausage at seven in the morning!</p>

<p>The Dresdener beguiled the way by laughing at the
peculiarities of three Berliners, whom we had left behind
at the <i>Gasthof</i>. A Prussian cockney, he said, was sure
to betray himself as soon as he began to talk, for nothing
would satisfy him but the most exalted superlatives.
"When you hear," he continued, "a man talk of a
thing as gigantic&mdash;incomprehensibly beautiful&mdash;ravishingly
excellent&mdash;insignificantly scarcely visible&mdash;set him
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
down at once as a Berliner. You heard those three last
night, how they went on; as we say in our country,
hanging their hats on the topmost pegs. Yracious
yoodness! what yiyantic yabble!" And the Saxon
cockney laughed as heartily at his own wit as if it had
been good enough for <i>Punch</i>.</p>

<p>The castle is an old possession of the Knights Templars,
repaired and beautified. It has towers and turrets,
and windows of quaint device; a small inner court,
and a surrounding moat spanned by a bridge at the
entrance. Outside the moat are shady walks and
avenues of limes, and the gardens, which did not come
up to my notion of what is royal either in fruits or
flowers. With plantations on the hills around, and in
the park, the whole place has a pleasant bowery aspect.</p>

<p>As we crossed the bridge, there seemed something
inhospitable in the sight of two large cannon guarding
the entrance; but the portress told us they were
trophies from Afghanistan, captured at the battle in
which Prince Waldemar was wounded&mdash;a present from
the British government. The fittings of the room are
mostly of varnished pine, to which the furniture and
hangings do no violence. There are a few good paintings,
among them a portrait of the Queen of Bavaria,
which you will remember for beauty above all the rest;
nor will you easily forget the marble head copied from
the statue of Queen Louisa in the mausoleum at Charlottenburg.
From looking at the rarities, the portress called
us to hear the singing of an artificial bird, and seemed
somewhat disappointed that we did not regard it as the
greatest curiosity of all.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span></p>

<p>"A snug little place," said the Dresdener, as we
walked from room to room. "Not quite what your
Princess Royal has been used to, perhaps; but she
will be able to pass summer holidays here agreeably
enough."</p>

<p>And quickly the question followed: "But what do
you think of the marriage in England. Is it very
popular?"</p>

<p>"Not very," I answered; "your Prussian Prince
would have stood no chance had the King of Sardinia
only been a Protestant. Nothing but her wholesome
ingredient of Protestantism saves Prussia from becoming
an offence to English nostrils."</p>

<p>"<i>So-o-o-o-o!</i>" ejaculated the Dresdener, while he
made pointed arches of his eyebrows. "That sounds
pretty in the Prince's own castle."</p>

<p>We went to the top of the tower, and looked out on
the domain, the mountain chain, and the encircling
hills&mdash;among which the rocky Falkenstein&mdash;the climbing
test of adventurous tourists&mdash;rises conspicuous. According
to tradition, great things are in store for the
quiet little village of Fischbach; it is destined to grow
into a city. In the <i>Kittnerberg</i>, a neighbouring hill,
a golden donkey is some day to be found, and when
found the city is forthwith to start up, and the finder to
be chosen first burgomaster.</p>

<p>Erdmannsdorf, once the estate of brave old Gneisenau,
was bought by the former King Frederick William III.,
who built in a style combining Moorish and Gothic the
<i>Schloss</i>, or palace, which, with its charming grounds
and bronze statues of men-at-arms at the entrance keeping
perpetual guard with battle-axes, rivals the Tyrolese
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
and their houses in attracting visitors. No barriers
separate the grounds from the public road, and you may
walk where you please along the broad sandy paths,
under tall groves, through luxuriant shrubberies, round
rippling lakes, and by streams which here and there
tumble over rocky dams. The place is a miniature
Chatsworth, with its model village. Within the limits
of the smooth green turf and well-kept walks stands the
church, an edifice with a tall square tower in the Byzantine
style. The palace, too, has a tall tower, from the
top of which, on our return to Erdmannsdorf&mdash;that is
the Dresdener and I&mdash;we got a view of the royal domain,
and the scattered houses of the Tyrolese, and
always in the background the <i>Riesengebirge</i>.</p>

<p>Remembering their native valley, the Tyrolese named
their settlement Zillerthal, and many a one comes here
expecting to see a romantic valley. But all immediately
beneath your eye is a great plain watered by the Lomnitz&mdash;the
stream which flows out of the Big Pond up in
the mountains&mdash;cut up by fields and meadows, crowded
with trees around the palace, and in the deer-park adjoining.
Only in Ober-Zillerthal, which lies nearer to
the mountains, do the colonists have the pleasure of ascending
or descending in their walks.</p>

<p>The Tyrolese themselves built their first house entirely
of wood, after the old manner; and this served as model
for all the rest, which, with stone walls for the lower
story, have been erected at the king's expense. The colonists
find occupation in cattle-breeding and field-work,
or in the great linen factory, the tall chimney of which
is seen from far across the plain; and are well cared for
in means of education and religious worship. In their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">254</a></span>
<i>Friedhof</i> you may see the first Tyrolese grave, the resting-place
of Jacob Egger, a blind old man of eighty-three,
who died soon after the immigration.</p>

<p>Not far from the palace is a singular group of rocks
named <i>Käse und Brod</i> (<i>Cheese and Bread</i>), on the
way to which you pass a stone quarry, where you can
pick up fine crystals of quartz, and see men digging
feldspar for the china-manufacturers at Berlin.</p>

<p>Here I parted from the Dresdener and took the road
to Warmbrunn&mdash;about six miles distant. Half way, at
the foot of the rocky <i>Prudelberg</i>, lies the village of
Stohnsdorf, famed for its beer; and not without reason.
But while you drink a glass, the landlord will tell you
that clever folk in distant places&mdash;Berlin or Dresden&mdash;damage
the fame by selling bottled <i>Stohnsdorfer</i> brewed
from the waters of the Spree or Elbe.</p>

<p>If inclined for a scramble up the <i>Prudelberg</i>, take a
peep into Rischmann's Cave among the rocks, for from
thence, in 1630, the prophet Rischmann delivered his
predictions with loud voice and wild gestures. He was
a poor weaver, who fancied himself inspired, and, although
struck dumb in 1613, could always find speech
when he had anything to foretel. Woe to Hirschberg
was the burden of his prophecy: war, pestilence, and
famine! The tower of the council-house should fall,
and the stream of the Zacken stand still. Honour and
reverence awaited the weaver, for everything came to
pass as he had foretold. The Thirty Years' War
brought pestilence and famine; the tower did fall down;
and the Zacken being one of those rivers with an intermittent
flow, its stream was subject to periodical repose.</p>

<p>After frequent ups and downs, you come to the brow
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">255</a></span>
of a hill which overlooks a broad sweep of the Hirschbergerthal,
and the little town of Warmbrunn, chief
among Silesian spas&mdash;lying cheerfully where the valley
spreads itself out widest towards the mountains. You
will feel tempted to sit down for awhile and gaze on the
view&mdash;for it has many pleasing features&mdash;touches of the
romantic with the pastoral, and the town itself wearing
an unsophisticated look. Seume said of the Hirschberg
Valley&mdash;"Seldom finds one a more delightful corner of
the earth; seldom better people."

The Three Berliners&mdash;Strong Beer&mdash;Origin of Warmbrunn&mdash;St. John the

</p>

<p class="p2">I had gone a little way along the street when I heard
voices crying, "<i>Eng-lischmann! Eng-lischmann! Eng-lischmann!</i>"
and, looking about, I saw the three Berliners
at the window of an hotel. "You must come
up!" "You must come up!" "You must come up!"
cried one after the other; so up I went. We had half
an hour of yood-natured yossip about our morning's adventures,
not forgetting the merits of Stohnsdorf; and
one of them said something about the famous beer that
justified the Dresdener's criticism. "Isn't it yood?
Isn't it strong? Why it is so strong that if you pour
some into your hand, and hold it shut for ten minutes,
you can never open it ayain!"</p>

<p>The old story. Some time in the twelfth century,
Duke Boleslaw IV., while out hunting, struck the trail
of a deer, and following it, was led to a <i>Warmbrunn</i>
(Warm Spring), in which, as by signs appeared, the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">257</a></span>
animals used to bathe. The duke bathed too, and perhaps
with benefit; for near by he built a chapel, and
dedicated it to the patron saint of Silesia&mdash;John the
Baptist. The news spread, even in those days; and with
it a belief that on St. John's Day the healing properties
of the spring were miraculously multiplied. Hence, on
the 24th of June, sick folk came from far and near to
bathe in the blessed water, and some, thanks to the
energy of their belief, went away cured. And this
practice was continued down to the year 1810.</p>

<p>Such was the origin of the present <i>Marktfleck</i> (Market
Village) Warmbrunn. In 1387 King Wenzel sold it
to Gotsche Schoff&mdash;Stemfather, as the Germans say,
of Count von Schaffgotsch, who now rules with generous
sway over the spa and estates that stretch for miles
around. It was he who built the <i>Schneegrubenhaus</i>;
who made the path up the Bohemian side of <i>Schneekoppe</i>;
who opens his gardens and walks to visitors,
and a library of forty thousand volumes with a museum
for their amusement and edification; who established a
bathing-house with twenty-four beds for poor folk who
cannot pay, and who spares no outlay of money or influence
to improve the place and attract strangers.</p>

<p>Warmbrunn now numbers about 2300 inhabitants,
who live upon the guests during the season, and the rest
of the year by weaving, bleaching, stone-polishing, and
wood-carving. Of hotels and houses of entertainment
there is no lack; the <i>Schwarzer Adler</i> and <i>Hôtel de
Prusse</i> among the best. But as at Carlsbad, nearly
every house has its sign, and lets lodgings, dearest close
to the baths, and cheaper as the distance increases, till
in the outskirts, and they are not far off, you can get a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">258</a></span>
room with attendance for two dollars a week, or less.
Of refectioners there is no lack in the place itself, or
about the neighbourhood.</p>

<p>There are six baths. The Count's and Provost's&mdash;or
Great and Little Baths&mdash;are near the middle of the
village, separated by the street. These are the oldest.
The water bursts up clear and sparkling from openings
in coarse-grained, flesh-red granite, at a temperature of
94 degrees Fahrenheit in the great basin, and 101
degrees in the little basin. It is soft on the palate, with
a taste and odour of sulphur, and in saline and alkaline
constituents resembles the waters of Aix-la-Chapelle
and Töplitz. It is efficacious in cases of gout, contractions,
skin diseases, and functional complaints; in some
instances with extraordinary results. I heard of patients
who come to Warmbrunn so crooked and crippled that
they can neither sit nor stand, nor lie in a natural posture,
who have to be lifted in and out of the bath, and
yet, after two months' bathing, have been able to walk
alone.</p>

<p>Although patients bathe a number together, the
throng is so great in the hot months that many have to
study a lesson in patience till their turn comes. Some,
to whom drinking the water is prescribed, resort to the
<i>Trinkquelle</i>; and in the other bathing-houses there are
all the appliances for douche, showers, vapour, and
friction. One room is fitted up with electrical and
galvanic apparatus, to be used in particular cases.</p>

<p>With so many visitors Warmbrunn has an appearance
of life and gaiety; the somewhat rustic shops put on an
upstart look, or a timid show of gentility. The <i>Allée</i>, a
broad tree-planted avenue opening from the main street,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">259</a></span>
by the side of the Count's <i>Schloss</i>, is the favourite promenade.
Here, among troops of Germans, you meet
Poles and Muscovites, some betraying their nationality
by outward signs. I saw three men of very dingy
complexion and sluggish movement, clad in shabby
black coats, with skirts reaching to their heels, who
seemed out of place among well-dressed promenaders.
They were Russian popes. Great personages have come
here at times in search of health, and on such occasions
the little spa has grown vain-glorious. In 1687 the
queen of John Sobieski III. came with one thousand
attendants. In 1702 came Prince Jacob, their son, and
stayed a year; and since then dignitaries without
number, among the latest of whom was Field-Marshal
Count von Ziethen, who took up his abode here in
1839.</p>

<p>There are a few paintings worth looking at in the
Romish church: one of them represents the rescue of a
Count Schaffgotsch from drowning; and in the Evangelical
church hang two portraits, one of the present
king, the other of Blucher. But the museum established
in the same building with the library, by the
liberality of the Count, is the great attraction. Among
the weapons you may see the scimitar which Sobieski
snatched with his own hand from the grand vizier's
tent when he raised the siege of Vienna; and near it a
horsetail standard, a trophy of the same event, brought
home by Johann Leopold von Schaffgotsch, one of the
Count's ancestry. In other rooms are a collection of
coins, of maps and charts&mdash;among them a few old globes,
interesting to geographers&mdash;the Lord's Prayer in one
hundred different languages, a model of the <i>Riesengebirge</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">260</a></span>
and other curiosities, which, with the library,
afford abundant means for instruction and amusement.
Then there is music twice a day in the <i>Schloss</i> garden,
and the theatre is open in the evening, besides the
numerous excursions to the hills and mountains around.</p>

<p>The <i>Allée</i>, about six hundred paces long, commands
a striking view of the mountain chain from its farther
end, where the ground falls away with gentle slope. I
could see the prominent points which I had walked
over a few days before; and nearer&mdash;about half an
hour's walk&mdash;the Kynast, that much-talked-of ruin,
crowning a dark-wooded hill. It attracts visitors as
much by its story as by its lofty and picturesque situation.
There once lived the beautiful but stony-hearted
Cunigunda, who doomed many a wooer to destruction;
for none could win her hand who had not first ridden
his horse round the castle on the top of the wall. One
after another perished; but she had vowed a vow, and
would not relent. At last came one whose handsome
face and noble form captivated at once the lady's heart.
She would have spared him the adventure, but her vow
could not be broken, and she watched with trembling
heart while the stranger knight rode along the giddy
height. He accomplished the task in safety; she would
have thrown herself into his arms; but with a slap on
her face, and a reproach for her cruelty, the Landgrave
Albert of Thuringia&mdash;for he it was, who had a wife at
home&mdash;turned his horse and galloped away.</p>

<p>While sauntering, I met the two Breslauers&mdash;my companions
on the descent to the <i>Grenzbäuden</i>&mdash;and under
their guidance explored yet more of the neighbourhood.
The guard at the frontier had treated them mercifully,
and after half an hour's detention in a little room up-stairs,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">261</a></span>
let them go. Since then they had been making
the usual round of excursions: to the fall of the Zacken,
to the Norwegian church at Wang, to the Annakapelle,
to Hirschberg, and other places&mdash;all within two or
three hours' walk. Two days more and they would
have to return to the counting-house at Breslau. Near
the refreshment-houses in the fields young girls followed
us offering packets of <i>Oblatt</i> for sale. This is a crisp
cake, of agreeable flavour, thinner and lighter than
the unleavened bread of the Jews, friendly to the enjoyment
of a glass of beer on a hot afternoon; as we proved
by eating a few packets while emptying our tankards in
full view of the mountains, under an airy colonnade.</p>

<p>On our return to the village we met the <i>Wirth</i> from
<i>Schneekoppe</i>, who had come down from his cloudy
dwelling to bury a relative. I took the opportunity to
send my compliments to Father Hübner, with a hint
that his topographical information had not appeared to
me of much more value than his man's morality.</p>

<p>Mineral springs are frequent in the mountains. Flinsberg,
a quiet village on the Queiss, about four hours
from Warmbrunn, in the <i>Isergebirge</i>, is resorted to by
women, to whom the saline water impregnated with
iron is peculiarly beneficial. One of the springs is so
highly charged with carbonic acid gas that the villagers
call it the <i>Bierbrunnen</i> (Beer Spring). And a short
distance beyond Flinsberg, on the Bohemian side of the
mountains, is Liebwerda, a romantic village, where
springs of health bubble up, and Wallenstein's castle is
within a walk. Quietest of all is Johannisbad, on the
southern slope below <i>Schneekoppe</i>, not far from Marschendorf.
There the fountains are lukewarm, and their
influence is promoted by complete seclusion and repose.

</p>

<p class="p2">It was so dark when the omnibus from Warmbrunn
arrived at Hirschberg&mdash;about five miles&mdash;that I lost
the sight of its pretty environment, watered by the
Bober and Zacken, and of its old picturesque houses,
the gables of which were dimly visible against the sky.
The town has more than seven thousand inhabitants,
and for trade ranks next to Breslau. Its history is
that of most towns along this side of Silesia: so much
suffering by war, that you wonder how they ever survived.
A memorial of the latest scourge is to be seen
in the Hospital churchyard&mdash;a cast-iron monument in
memory of three Prussians, who, wounded at Lützen in
1813, died here on the same day. Under their names
runs the inscription: <i>They died in an Iron time for a
Golden</i>.</p>

<p>Not being able to see anything, I booked a place by
<i>Stellwagen</i> for Görlitz, and supped in preparation for a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">263</a></span>
night of travel. We started at eleven, a company
numerous enough to fill three vehicles, those lowest on
the list taking their seats in the hindmost. As these
hindmost carriages are changed at every stopping-place
with the horses, I and other unfortunates had to turn
out at unseasonable hours, and to find, in two instances,
that we had not changed for the better&mdash;soft seats and
cleanliness for hard seats and fustiness. So at Spiller:
so at Greifenberg.</p>

<p>It adds somewhat to one's experiences to be roused
from uneasy slumber at midnight with notice to alight.
You feel for umbrella and knapsack, and step down
into the chill gloom of a summer night; and while the
leisurely work of changing goes on, stroll a little way
up or down the roughly-paved street, looking at the
strange old houses, all so still and lifeless, as if they
were fast asleep as well as their inmates. Why should
you be awake and shivering when honest folk are
a-bed? and you feel an inclination to envy the
sleepers. If you turn a corner and get out of sight of
the Posthouse, the houses look still more lonely and
unprotected: not a glimmer to be seen, and it seems
unfair that every one should be comfortable but you.
Or from the outside of a house you picture to yourself
those who inhabit it; or, perhaps, you get a peep into
the churchyard, or venture through a dark arch to
what looks like an ancient cloister, and your drowsy
thought gives way to strange imaginings.</p>

<p>But the night is chilly. Let us go into the Posthouse.
There is comfort by the stove in the inner
room, and the woman who has sat up to await our
arrival brings an acceptable refreshment of coffee and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">264</a></span>
cakes. Steaming coffee, with the true flavour; and not
sixpence a cup, but six kreutzers. Then the driver
blows his horn, and each one takes his allotted seat, to
slumber if he can through another jolting stage.</p>

<p>Greifenberg, a town of three thousand inhabitants,
on the Queiss, is proud of four things: manufacture of
fine linen and damask, a griffin in its coat-of-arms, and
a right royal word of the Great Frederick. Certain
deputies having appeared before the monarch to thank
him for his prompt and generous aid in restoring the
town after a great fire in 1783&mdash;"For that am I here!"
was his kingly reply.</p>

<p>About two miles distant is the Greifenstein, a basaltic
hill, so named from a nest of young griffins found
on the top of it at a date which no one can remember.
It is now crowned by the ruins of a castle which was
given by the Emperor Charles IV., in the fourteenth
century, as a reward for service to the brave Silesian
knight Schaffgotsch. Were it daylight we might see
in the Romish church a vault which has been the burial-place
of the Schaffgotsch family since 1546.</p>

<p>It was early morning when we came to Lauban, and
changed carriages by the side of the grass-grown moat
at a break in the old round-towered wall. The view
from the adjacent <i>Steinberg</i> is described as equal in
beauty to any other scene in Prussia. Unfortunately I
had not time to judge for myself; but hope to go and
see some future day. Perhaps, while waiting here, you
will be reminded that Lauban was one of the Silesian
towns which, on the 19th of August, 1836, held a
jubilee to celebrate the three hundredth anniversary
of the introduction of the potato into Europe by the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">265</a></span>
famous circumnavigator Drake&mdash;as the promoters said.
Of course potatoes cooked in many ways appeared plentifully
at every table over half the province.</p>

<p>We reached Görlitz at eight, and for some reason,
perhaps known to the driver, went through the streets
in and out, up and down, across the Neisse to the
<i>Postamt</i> in the new quarter, at a slow walking pace. I
had three hours to wait for a train, and to improve the
time, after comforting myself at the <i>Goldenen Strauss</i>,
mounted to the top of the Peter and Paul church tower.
Erected on a rocky eminence, rising steeply from the
river, it commands a wide prospect. The town itself,
a busy place of more than 18,000 inhabitants, closely
packed, as in the olden time, around the church; spreading
out beyond into broad, straight streets and squares,
well-planted avenues, and pretty pleasure-grounds; and
in this roomy border you see bleaching-greens, the barracks,
the gymnasium, and observatory. From thence
your eye wanders over the hills of Lusatia to the distant
mountains&mdash;a fair region, showing a thousand
slopes to the sun. About two miles distant the <i>Landskrone</i>
rises from the valley of the Neisse&mdash;a conspicuous
rocky hill bristling with trees. We got a glimpse of it
from <i>Schneekoppe</i>; and now you will perhaps fancy it a
watch-tower, midway between the Giant Mountains and
the romantic highlands of Saxony.</p>

<p>The sight of that hill recalls the name of the "Teutonic
philosopher"&mdash;Jacob Böhme. He was born at
Alt-Seidenberg, about a mile from Görlitz, in 1575;
and he relates that one day when employing himself as
herdboy, to relieve the monotony of shoemaking, he
discovered a cool bosky crevice on the <i>Landskrone</i>, and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">266</a></span>
crept in for shelter from the heat of the sun. Inside, to
his great surprise, he saw a wooden bowl, or vase, full
of money, which he feared to touch, and went presently
and told certain of his playmates of the discovery.
With them he returned to the hill; but though they
searched and searched again, they could never find the
cleft, nor the wonderful hoard. A few years later, however,
there came a cunning diviner, who, exploring with
his rod, discovered the money and carried it off; and soon
after perished miserably, for a curse had been declared
on whomsoever should touch the gold.</p>

<p>Fate had other things in store for Jacob, and allured
him from his last to write voluminous works on theosophy,
wherein he discusses the most mysterious questions
about the soul, its relations to God and the universe,
and such like; and great became the poor
shoemaker's repute among the learned. Some travelled
from far to confer with him; some translated his books
into French and English; some studied German that
they might read them in the original; and even Isaac
Newton used at times to divert his mind from laborious
search after the laws of gravitation by perusal of
Böhme's speculations. That Jacob was not a dreamer
on all points is clear from what he used to pen for those
who begged a scrap of his writing:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p class="o1">"<i>Wem Zeit ist wie Ewigkeit,</i></p>
<p><i>Und Ewigkeit wie die Zeit,</i></p>
<p><i>Der ist befreit von allem Streit.</i>"<a name="FNanchor_I" id="FNanchor_I" href="#Footnote_I" class="fnanchor">[I]</a></p>
</div></div>

<p>There is something to be seen in the church itself as
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">267</a></span>
well as from the top of the tower. It is a singularly
beautiful specimen of Gothic architecture of the fifteenth
century. The great height of the nave, with the light
and graceful form of the columns and arches, produce
an admirable effect, to which the high altar, the carved
stone pulpit, and the large organ do no violence. It is
one of those buildings you could linger in for hours,
contemplating now its fair proportions, now the old
tombs and monuments, and quaint devices of the
sculptor's art. Below the floor at the eastern end is an
underground chapel, a century older than the church
itself, hewn out of the solid rock. Preaching is held in
it once a year. The attendant will make you aware in
the dim light of a spring that simmers gently up and
fills a basin scooped in the solid stone of the floor.</p>

<p>The church of the Holy Cross in the Nicolai suburb
is remarkable as having been built, and with a sepulchre,
after the original at Jerusalem by a burgomaster of Görlitz,
who travelled twice to Jerusalem, in 1465 and in 1476,
to procure the necessary plans and measurements for the
work. There is a singularity about the sepulchre: it is
always either too long or too short for any corpse that
may be brought to it, and yet appears large enough for
a Hercules.</p>

<p>The town possesses two good libraries, each containing
about twenty thousand volumes. In the <i>Rathsbibliothek</i>
you may see rare manuscripts, among them the <i>Sachsenspiegel</i>;
and a book which purports to have been printed
before the invention of printing, bearing date 1400!
The other library belongs to the Society for the Promotion
of Science, who have besides a good collection of
maps, fossils, minerals, and philosophical instruments.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">268</a></span>
Perhaps here in England writers and scholars in provincial
towns will some day be able to resort to libraries
and museums as easily as in the small towns of Germany.
Many an English student would be thankful to find in
his native town even one such library as those at Görlitz.</p>

<p>The train from Breslau kept good time. It dropped
me at Loebau, where there is a church in which service
is performed in the Wendish tongue. From hence a
branch line runs to Zittau. I stopped half way at
Herrnhut, the head-quarters of the Moravians: a place
I had long wished to see.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">269</a></span></p>

<h2>CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

</p>

<p class="p2">I had seen the Moravian colony at Zeist near Utrecht,
and was prepared for a similar order of things at Herrnhut.
A short distance from the station along the high
road to Zittau, and you come to a well-built, quiet street,
rising up a gentle ascent, where, strange sight in Saxony,
the footways are paved with broad stone slabs. Farther
on you come to a broad opening, where two other main
streets run off, and here the inn, <i>Gemeinlogis</i>, and the
principal buildings are situate, all substantially built of
brick. Everywhere the same quietness, neatness, and
cleanliness, the same good paving, set off in places by
rows and groups of trees, and hornbeam hedges.</p>

<p>The innkeeper&mdash;or steward as he may be called, for he
is a paid servant of the brotherhood&mdash;told me there
would be a <i>Gottesdienst</i> (God's service) at three o'clock,
and suggested my occupying the interval with the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">270</a></span>
newspapers that lay on the table. There was the <i>Görlitzer
Anzeiger</i>, published three times a week, Sunday,
Tuesday, and Thursday, four good quarto pages, for
fifteen pence a quarter; and equally cheap the <i>Zittauische
Wochentliche Nachrichten</i>. But I preferred a stroll
through the village and into the spacious gardens, which,
teeming with fruit, flowers, and vegetables, stretch away
to the south, and unite with the pleasure-walks in the
bordering wood.</p>

<p>At three I went to the church. Outside no pains
have been taken to give it an ecclesiastical look; inside
it contains a spacious hall, large enough to contain the
whole community, with a gallery at each end, and on
the floor two divisions of open seats made of unpainted
fir placed opposite a dais along the wall. Whatever is
painted is white&mdash;white walls, white panelling, white
curtains to the windows, and a white organ. Something
Quaker-like in appearance and arrangement. But when
a number of women came in together wearing coloured
cap-ribbons, passing broad and full under the chin, a
lively contrast was opposed to the prevailing sobriety of
aspect. The colours denote age and condition. The
unmarried sisters put on cherry-red at sixteen, and
change it after eighteen for pink. The married wear
dark blue, and the widows white. Many a pretty,
beaming face was there among them, yet sedate withal.</p>

<p>The choir assembled on each side of a piano placed
in the opening between the benches, for the organ was
undergoing a course of repair. No practical jokes
among them, as in the cathedral on the Hradschin; but
all sedate too. Presently came in from the door on the
left five dignified-looking sisters, and took their seats
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">271</a></span>
on one half of the dais; then seven brethren, among
whom a bishop or two, from the door on the right, to
the other half; and their leader, a tall man of handsome,
intelligent countenance, to the central seat at the desk.</p>

<p>The service was in commemoration of a sister whom
in the morning the congregation had followed to her
resting-place in the <i>Gottesacker</i> (God's acre). The choir
stood up, all besides remaining seated, and sang a requiem,
and sang it well; for the Moravians, wiser than
the Quakers, do not cheat their hearts and souls of
music. A hymn followed, in which the whole assembly
joined, the several voices according to their part, till one
great solemn harmony filled the building. Then the
preacher at the desk, still sitting, began an exhortation,
in which a testimony concerning the deceased was interwoven
with simple Gospel truth. His word and
manner were alike impressive; no passion, no whining.
Rarely have I heard such ready, graceful eloquence,
combined with a clear and ringing voice. He ended
suddenly: a hymn was sung, at the last two lines of
which every one stood up, and with a few words of
prayer the service was closed. It had lasted an hour.
The congregation, which numbered about three hundred,
dispersed quietly, the children walking as sedately
as their parents.</p>

<p>All the roads leading out of Herrnhut are pleasant
avenues of trees&mdash;limes, oaks, beech, and birch. A short
distance along the one leading to Berthelsdorf you come
to a wooden arch bearing the inscription, "Christ is
risen from the dead." It is the entrance to <i>God's
field</i>; and if you turn on entering, you will see written
on the inside of the arch, "And become the firstling
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">272</a></span>
of them that slept." The ground slopes gently upwards
to the brow of the <i>Hutberg</i>, divided into square compartments
by broad paths and clipped limes. Within
these compartments are the graves; no mounds; nothing
but rows of thick stone slabs, each about two feet in
length, by one and a half in width, lying on the grass.
All alike; no one honoured above the rest, except in
some instances by a brief phrase in addition to the name,
age, and birthplace. The first at the corner has been
renewed, that a record of an interesting incident in the
history of the place may not be lost. The inscription
reads: <i>Christian David, the Lord's servant, born the 31st
December, 1690, at Senftleben in Moravia. Went home
the 3rd February, 1751</i>.</p>

<p><i>A carpenter: he felled the first tree for the building of
Herrnhut, the 17th June, 1722.</i></p>

<p><i>Went home</i> and <i>fell asleep</i> are favourite expressions
occurring on many of the stones. <i>A member of the
Conference of Elders</i> is a frequent memorial on the
oldest slabs, numbers of which are blackened, and
spotted with moss by age. There are two counts and
not a few bishops among the departed, but the same
plain slab suffices for all. The separation of the sexes is
preserved even after death, some of the compartments
being reserved exclusively for women. As you read
the names of birthplaces, in lands remote, from all
parts of Europe and oversea, the West Indies and
Labrador, you will perhaps think that weary pilgrims
have journeyed from far to find rest for their souls in
peaceful Herrnhut.</p>

<p>There is, however, one marked exception to the rule
of uniformity as regards the slabs. It is in favour of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">273</a></span>
Count Zinzendorf and his wife and immediate relatives&mdash;a
family deservedly held in high respect by the
Brethren. Eight monumental tombs, placed side by
side across the central path, perpetuate the names of the
noble benefactors. Of the count himself it is recorded:
<i>He was appointed to bear fruit, and a fruit that yet
remains</i>.</p>

<p>On the summit of the hill, beyond the hedge of the
burial-ground, a wooden pavilion is built with a circular
gallery, from whence you get a fine panoramic
view of the surrounding country. The innkeeper had
given me the key, and I loitered away an hour looking
out on the prospect. Now you see the <i>Gottesacker</i>, with
its fifteen formal clipped squares, some yet untenanted,
and room for enlargement; the red roofs and white walls
of the village; and beyond, the fir-topped <i>Heinrichsberg</i>,
and planted slopes which beautify the farther end of
the place. Berthelsdorf, the seat of the <i>Unität</i>, stands
pleasantly embowered at the foot of the eastern slope.
You see miles of road, two or three windmills, and umbrageous
green lines thinning off in the distance, the
trees all planted by the Herrnhuters; and the fields,
orchards, and plantations that fill all the space between,
testify to the diligent husbandry of the Brethren.</p>

<p>Every place and prominent object within sight is indicated
by a red line notched into the top rail of the
balustrade, so that, while sauntering slowly round, you
can read the name of any spire or distant peak that
catches your eye. The summits are numerous, for hills
rise on every side; among them you discover the Landskrone
by Görlitz, and the crown of the <i>Tafelfichte</i> in the
<i>Isergebirge</i>, the only one of the mountains within sight.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">274</a></span>
It is a view that will give you a cheerful impression of
Saxony.</p>

<p>The doorkeeper of the church had noticed a stranger,
and came up for a talk. I asked him how much
of what lay beneath our eyes belonged to the Brethren.
"About two hundred acres," he answered, pointing
all round, and to an isolated estate away in the direction
of Zittau; "enough for comfort and prosperity."
Once started, he proved himself no niggard of information.
To give the substance of his words: "I like the
place very well," he said, "and don't know of any discontent;
though we have at times to lament that a
brother falls away from us back into the worldly ways.
Each fulfils his duty. We are none of us idle. We
have weavers, shoemakers, harness-makers, coppersmiths,
goldsmiths, workers in iron, lithographers, and
artists; indeed, all useful trades; and our workmanship
and manufactures are held in good repute. I am a
cabinet-maker, and keep eight journeymen always at
work. Each one from the age of eighteen to sixty takes
his turn in the night-watch; and, night and day, the
place is always as quiet as you see it now. You don't
hear the voices of children at play, because children are
never left to themselves. Whether playing or walking,
they are always under the eye of an adult, as when in
school. We do not think it right to leave them unwatched.
We have service three times every Sunday,
and at seven o'clock every evening; besides certain
festivals, and a memorial service like that of this afternoon.
The preacher you heard is considered a good
one: his salary is four hundred dollars a year."</p>

<p>He interrupted his talk by an invitation to go and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">275</a></span>
see the grounds of the <i>Heinrichsberg</i>. As we walked
along the street, I could not fail again to remark the
absence of sounds which generally inspire pleasure. No
merry laughter, accompanied by hearty shouts and
quick foot-tramp of boys at play. No running hither
and thither at hide-and-seek; no trundling of hoops;
no laughing girls with battledore and shuttlecock. I saw
but two children, apparently brother and sister, and they
were walking as soberly as bishops. I should like to
know whether such a repressive system does really answer
the purpose intended; for I could not help questioning,
in Goldsmith's words, whether the virtue that
requires so constant a guard be worth the expense of
the sentinel.</p>

<p>The <i>Heinrichsberg</i> is behind the <i>Bruderhaus</i> and the
street leading to Zittau. Here the fir forest, which
once covered the whole hill, has been cut down, and replaced
by plantations of beech, birch, hazel, and other
leafy trees, and paths are led in many directions along
the precipitous slopes, by which you approach a pavilion
erected on the commanding point, as at the <i>Gottesacker</i>.
The situation is romantic, overhanging the brown cliffs
of a stone quarry, with a view into a deep wooded
valley, spanned by the lofty railway viaduct. Here the
Brethren have shown themselves wise in their generation,
and, working with skilful hand, and eye of taste,
have made the most of natural resources, and fashioned
a resort especially delightful in the sultry days of
summer.</p>

<p>When my communicative guide left me to attend to
his duties, I strolled up the Zittau road to the place
where, in a small opening by the wayside, stands a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">276</a></span>
square stone monument, on which an inscription records
an interesting historical incident:</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p><i>On the 17th June, 1772, was</i></p>
<p><i>on this place for the building</i></p>
<p><i>of Herrnhut the first tree felled.</i></p>
<p class="i6">Ps. lxxxiv. 4.</p>
</div></div>

<p>It was cool there in the shade; and sitting down on
a seat overhung by the trees, I fell into a reverie about
things that had befallen since Christian David's axe
wrought here to such good purpose. At that time all
was dreary forest; no house nearer than Berthelsdorf,
and little could the poverty-stricken refugees have foreseen
such a result of their struggle as Herrnhut in its
present condition. All at once I was interrupted by an
elderly woman, who, returning to her village, sought a
rest on the plinth of the monument, and proved herself
singularly talkative. Perhaps she owed the Brethren a
grudge, for she wound up with: "Nice people, them,
sir, in Herrnhut; but they know how to get the money,
sir."</p>

<p>About two hundred persons, mostly youthful, were
present at the evening service. The dais was occupied
as before, but by a lesser number. The preacher, the
same eloquent man, gave an exposition of a portion of
the <i>Epistle to the Romans</i>, elucidating the Apostle's
meaning in obscure passages, which lasted half an hour.
He then pronounced a brief benediction, and delivered
the first line of a hymn, which was sung by all present,
and, as in the afternoon, only at the last two lines did
any one stand up.</p>

<p>I was deeply impressed by the contrast between the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">277</a></span>
two services here in the unadorned edifice, and what I
witnessed at Prague. Here no ancient prejudice, or
ancient dirt, or slovenly ritual, as in the synagogue; but
the outpouring of hope and faith from devout and cheerful
hearts. Here no showy ceremonial; no swinging of
censers, or kissing of pictures, or endless bowings and
kneelings, or any of those mechanical observances in
which the worshipper too often forgets that it has been
given to him to be his own priest, and with full and
solemn responsibility for neglect of duty.</p>

<p>The service over, I went and asked permission to
look over the Sisters' House: I had seen the Brothers'
House at Zeist. It was past the hour for the admission
of strangers; but the stewardess, as a special favour, conducted
me from floor to floor, where long passages give
access on either side to small sitting-rooms, workrooms,
and one great bedroom; all scrupulously clean and
comfortably furnished. The walls are white; but any
sister is at liberty to have her own room papered at her
own cost. I saw the chapel in which the inmates assemble
for morning and evening thanksgiving;&mdash;the
refectory where they all eat together;&mdash;the kitchen,
pervaded by a savoury smell of supper;&mdash;and the ware-room
in which are kept the gloves, caps, cuffs, and all
sorts of devices in needlework produced by the diligent
fingers of the sisters. There were some neither too
bulky nor too heavy for my knapsack, and of these I
bought a few for sedate friends in England.</p>

<p>The unmarried sisters, as the unmarried brothers,
dwell in a house apart; and as they eat together, and
purchase all articles of consumption in gross, the cost to
each is but small. Two persons are placed in authority
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">278</a></span>
over each house; one to care for the spiritual, the other
for the economical welfare of the inmates. There are,
besides, separate houses for widowers and widows.</p>

<p>As the sun went down I strolled once more to the
<i>Gottesacker</i> and dreamt away a twilight hour on the
gallery of the pavilion. As the golden radiance vanished
from off the face of the landscape, and the stillness became
yet more profound, I thought that many a heart
weary of battling with the world might find in the
<i>Work and Worship</i> of Herrnhut a relief from despair,
and a new ground for hopefulness.</p>

<p>When I went back to the inn I found half a dozen
grave-looking Brethren smoking a quiet pipe over a
tankard of beer. We had some genial talk together
while I ate my supper; but as ten o'clock approached
they all withdrew. The doors were then fastened; and
not a sound disturbed the stillness of the night. The
watchers began their nightly duty; but they utter no
cry as they go their rounds, leading a fierce dog by a
thong, while three or four other dogs run at liberty.
Should their aid be required in any house from sickness
or other causes, a signal is given by candles placed
in the window.

</p>

<p class="p2">While I sat by the monument of the first tree, and
lingered in the glow of sunset at the pavilion, a desire
came upon me to know something more of the history
of Herrnhut. I partly gratify it in the present chapter.</p>

<p>When the sanguinary Hussite wars ended in the
triumph of the Jesuits, there remained in Bohemia and
Moravia numbers of godly-minded Protestants, who, as
the oppressor grew in strength, were forbidden the free
exercise of their religion. They worshipped by stealth,
hiding in caves and thickets, and suffered frightful persecution;
but remained steadfast, and formed a union
among themselves for mutual succour, and became the
United Brethren. Their chief settlements were at
Fulnek, in Moravia, and Lititz, in Bohemia. Though
professing the principles of the earliest Christian
church, many of them embraced the doctrines of Luther
and Calvin, whereby they subjected themselves to aggravated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">280</a></span>
persecutions; and cruelly were they smitten
by the calamities of the Thirty Years' War.</p>

<p>About 1710 a Roman Catholic carpenter set out from
the little Moravian village, Senftleben, to fulfil his three
"wander-years," and gain experience in his trade.
While working at Berlin, he frequented the Evangelical
Lutheran church; and afterwards at Görlitz the impression
made on his mind by a Lutheran preacher was
such that he went back to his home a Protestant. He
was a bringer of good tidings to some of his relatives
who were among the persecuted. He could tell them
of a kingdom beyond the frontier where they might
worship unmolested; of a youthful Count Zinzendorf,
who had large estates in the hill-country of Saxony, and
was already known as a benefactor to such as suffered
for conscience' sake.</p>

<p>It was on Whit-Monday, 1722, that Christian David&mdash;so
the carpenter was named&mdash;brought the news.
Three days later, two families, numbering ten persons,
abandoned their homes, and under David's guidance
came safely to Görlitz, after a nine days' journey. On
the 8th of June the four men travelled to Hennersdorf,
the residence of Zinzendorf's grandmother, who placed
them under charge of the land-steward, with instructions
that houses should be built for them. But as the steward
wrote to his master, "the good people seek for the
present a place only under which they may creep with
wife and children, until houses be set up." After much
consideration, it was resolved to build on the <i>Hutberg</i>,
a hill traversed by the road from Loebau to Zittau&mdash;then
a miserable track, in which vehicles sank to their
axles. "God will help," replied the steward to one of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">281</a></span>
his friends, who doubted the finding of water on the
spot; and on the two following mornings he rose before
the sun and went upon the hill to observe the mists.
What he saw led him to believe in the existence of a
spring; whereupon he took courage, and, as he tells the
Count, "I laid the miseries and desires of these people
before the Lord with hot tears, and besought Him that
His hand might be with me, and prevent wherein my
intentions were unpleasing to Him. Further I said, On
this place will I build the first house for them in thy
name."</p>

<p>A temporary residence was found for the fugitives;
the benevolent grandmother gave a cow that the children
might have milk; and on June 17th, as already mentioned,
the first tree was felled by Christian David. On
the 11th of August the house was erected; the preacher
at Berthelsdorf took occasion to refer to it as "a light
set on the hill to enlighten the whole land;" and in October
it was taken possession of with prayer and thanksgiving,
the exiles singing from their hearts&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"Jerusalem! God's city thou."</p>
</div></div>

<p>The steward, writing about this time to inform the
Count of his proceedings, says: "May God bless the
work according to His goodness, and procure that your
excellency may build on the hill called the <i>Hutberg</i> a
city which not only may stand under the <i>Herrn Hut</i>
(Lord's protection), but all dwellers upon the <i>Lord's
watch</i>, so that day and night there be no silence among
them." Here we have the origin of the name of the
place.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the neighbourhood laughed and joked
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">282</a></span>
about the building of a house in so lonely a spot, where
it must soon perish; and still more when the digging
for the spring was commenced. The land-steward had
much ado to keep the labourers to their work. Fourteen
days did they dig in vain; but in the third week they
came to moist gravel, and soon water streamed forth in
superabundance.</p>

<p>On December 21st the Count arrived with his newly-married
wife, and was surprised at sight of a house in a
place which he had left a forest. He went in; spoke
words of comfort to the inmates, and falling on his
knees, prayed earnestly for protection.</p>

<p>In the next year, Christian David journeyed twice
into Moravia. The priests, angered at the departure of the
first party, had worried their relatives, and forbade them
to emigrate under penalty of imprisonment. Would not
let them live in peace at home, nor let them go. Aided,
however, by the messenger, twenty-six persons forsook
their little possessions, their all, and stole away by
night. "Goods left behind," says the historian, "but
faith in their Father in the heart." They reached the
asylum, where, by the spring of 1724, five new houses
were ready to receive them.</p>

<p>In this year came other fugitives, experienced in the
church discipline of the old Moravian Brethren; and as
the number yet increased, they besought the Count to
institute the same constitution and discipline in Herrnhut.
But differences of opinion arose, and for three
years the harmony and permanence of the colony were
seriously endangered. The Count, however, was not a
man to shrink from a good work; he was remarkable for
his power of influencing minds; and on the 12th of May,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">283</a></span>
1727, after a three hours' discourse, he succeeded in reconciling
all differences, and the Reformed Evangelical
United Brotherhood of the Augsburg Confession was
established. This day, as well as the 13th of August of
the same year, when the whole community renewed and
confirmed their union in the church at Berthelsdorf, are
days never to be forgotten by the Brethren.</p>

<p>The success of Herrnhut was now secure. The number
of residents had increased to three hundred, of whom
one half were fugitives from Moravia. But they had
still to endure privation; for they had abandoned all
their worldly substance, and trade and tillage advanced
but slowly: in the first six months, all that the two
cutlers took from the passers-by was but two groschen:
a lean twopence. Friedrich von Watteville, however,
a much-beloved friend of the Count's, took a room in
one of the houses that he might live among the struggling
people, and help them in their endeavours.</p>

<p>Of the thirty-four small wooden houses which then
stood on both sides of the Zittau road not one now remains.
In their place large and handsome houses of
brick have risen, which, though the place be but a village,
give it the appearance of a city. Besides those which
have been mentioned, there are the <i>Herrschaftshaus</i>,
the <i>Vogtshof</i>&mdash;a somewhat palatial edifice&mdash;the <i>Gemeinhaus</i>,
the <i>Apotheke</i>, the <i>Pilgerhaus</i>, and others. An
ample supply of water is brought in by wooden pipes,
and two engines and eight cisterns in different quarters
are always ready against fire. There are covered stalls
for the sale of meat and vegetables; a common wash-house
and wood-yard, and a dead-house, all under the
charge and inspection of a <i>Platzaufseher</i>&mdash;an overseer
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">284</a></span>
who most undoubtedly does his duty. If ædiles in other
places would only take a lesson from him, their constituents
would have reason to be proud and grateful. An
almoner is appointed to succour indigent strangers. In
1852 he relieved 3668 tramping journeymen.</p>

<p>Year by year the Herrnhuters improved in circumstances,
though often at hard strife with penury. However,
they preferred hunger, with freedom of conscience,
to the tender mercies of the Jesuits at Olmutz. The
weavers of Bernstadt sent them wool to spin. In 1742
an order for shoes for the army was regarded as a special
favour of Providence. The Seven Years' War, that
brought misery to so many places, worked favourably
for Herrnhut. In one day a hundred officers visited
the place. Prince Henry of Prussia came and made
large purchases, for the work of the shoemakers and
tailors, not being made merely to sell, was much prized;
and it sometimes happened that from 1500 to 2000
dollars were taken in one day. Austrians and Prussians&mdash;fierce
foes&mdash;rode in alternately to buy; and while
Herrnhut flourished, many erroneous notions which
had prevailed concerning it were removed by what the
visitors saw of the simple life and manners of the
Brethren.</p>

<p>To Abraham Dürninger, who established a manufacture
of linen cloths, and whose skill and enterprise as a
merchant were only matched by his ceaseless activity,
the colony owed the mainstay of its commercial prosperity.
Brother Dürninger's linen and woven goods
were largely exported, particularly to Spain, South
America, and the West Indies, and esteemed above all
others in the market for the excellence of their quality.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">285</a></span>
The trade has since fallen off, but not the reputation, as
gold and silver medals awarded to the Herrnhuters by
the governments of Prussia and Saxony for honest
workmanship amply testify.</p>

<p>In 1760, notwithstanding that many colonies and
missions had been sent out, the population numbered
1200. This was the highest. The number remained
stationary until the end of the century; since then it has
slowly decreased, owing, as is said, to the decline of
trade. In 1852 it was 925. No new buildings have
been erected since 1805, so that Herrnhut has the appearance
of a place completely finished. The streets
were paved, and flagged footways laid down, eighty
years ago; and since 1810 all the roads leading from
the village have been planted and kept in good condition.</p>

<p>Well-managed elementary schools supply all that is
needful for ordinary education. Pupils who exhibit
capabilities for higher training are sent to the <i>Pedagogium</i>
at Nisky, a village built by Bohemian refugees
near Görlitz. Theological students are trained at the
seminary in Gnadenfeld, in the principality of Oppeln;
and those for the missions at Klein Welke, a village
near Budissin, established as a dwelling-place for converts
from among the Wends.</p>

<p>Fifty-seven Moravian settlements and societies in
different parts of the continent of Europe&mdash;Russia,
Sweden, Holland, Germany, some founded by emigrants
from Herrnhut, and all taking it for their pattern,
mark the growth of the principles advocated by the
Brethren. In England they have eleven settlements,
among which Fulneck, in Yorkshire, renews the name
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">286</a></span>
of the old Moravian village; and Ockbrook, in Derbyshire,
is the seat of the conference which directs the
affairs of the British settlements, but always with responsibility
to the Conference of Elders at Berthelsdorf.
Scotland has one community&mdash;at Ayr; and Ireland
seven. At the last reckoning, in 1848, the number of
real members, exclusive of the societies, was 16,000.</p>

<p>Besides these, there are seventy foreign mission-stations,
the duties of which are fulfilled by 297
Brethren. The number of persons belonging to the
several missions is 70,000. That in North America
was commenced in 1734; Greenland, 1733; Labrador,
1770. The others are in the West Indies, Musquito
territory, Surinam, South Africa, and Australia. At
the instance of Dr. Gutzlaff, who visited Herrnhut in
1850, two missionaries have been sent to Mongolia.<a name="FNanchor_J" id="FNanchor_J" href="#Footnote_J" class="fnanchor">[J]</a></p>

<p>Although life at Herrnhut may appear tame and joyless
to an ordinary observer, it is not so to the Herrnhuters.
A lasting source of pleasure to them are the
cheerful situation of the place itself, and the delightful
walks fashioned and planted by their own hands. Lectures,
the study of foreign languages, and of natural
history, and music, are among their permanent recreations.
They excel in harmony, and find, as their celebrations
partake more or less of a religious character, in
the singing of oratorios, choruses, and hymns, an animating
and elevating resource. They observe the anniversary
of the foundation of Herrnhut, and of all other
important incidents of its history, and thus have numerous
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">287</a></span>
festival days. In some instances, instrumental
music, decorations of fir-branches, and an illumination,
heighten the effect.</p>

<p>Betrothals are times of gladness; baptism and marriage
of solemn joy. Weddings always take place in the
evening; and in the evening also are held, once in four
weeks, the celebrations of the Lord's Supper. On these
occasions the whole community are present. Three or
four brothers who have received ordination, wearing
white gowns, break the thin cakes of unleavened bread
and distribute to the assembly, and when the last is
served all eat together. The cup is then blessed and
passed in order from seat to seat.</p>

<p>On certain festive occasions love-feasts are held, after
the manner of the <i>Agapæ</i> of the earliest Christian
churches. At these gatherings, which are intended to
show the family ties which unite the members of the
community with the spiritual head of the church,
suitable discourse is held, hymns are sung; and cakes
and tea&mdash;with at times wine and coffee&mdash;are partaken
of.</p>

<p>The Easter-morning celebration is especially remarkable.
On that morning the whole brotherhood assemble
before sunrise in the church, should the weather prove
unfavourable; if fine, in the open air. Then they walk
two by two, the trumpets sounding before them, to the
hill of the <i>Gottesacker</i>, to watch from thence the rising
of the sun. Arrived on the height, they form into a great
square: the prayers and praises of the Easter-morning
liturgy are then prayed and sung; meanwhile the sun
appears above the dim and distant horizon; a spectacle
in which the beholders see a foretoken of that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">288</a></span>
glorious resurrection where, in the words of a brother,
"the grave is not, nor death." Then the names of
those who died during the past year are read, and with
affectionate remembrances of them the celebration closes.</p>

<p>The service on New Year's Eve is so numerously
attended from all the neighbourhood round, that the
church will hardly contain the throng. At half-past
eleven a discourse is begun, in which the events of the
year about to close are passed in review, with other subjects
appropriate to the time, until, as the clock strikes
twelve, the trumpet choir sound hail! to the new year.
Then the verse</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poem">
<p>"Now all give thanks to God"</p>
</div></div>

<p>is sung, and with a prayer the service ends.</p>

<p>Burials are characterized by a simplicity worthy of
all imitation; in striking contrast to the vain and oft-times
ludicrous proceedings, by which folk in some
other places think they do honour to the dead. The
Brethren assemble&mdash;wearing no kind of mourning except
in their hearts&mdash;in the church, where a short discourse
is delivered, and a narrative of the deceased's
life is read. The procession is then formed, preceded
by the trumpet-band, who blow sacred melodies; and the
corpse is carried on a bright-coloured bier, covered with
a striped pall, by four brothers, dressed in their usual
clothes. The nearest relatives follow, and behind them
the community, according to kin. They form a circle
round the grave and sing a hymn, accompanied by the
trumpets, during which the coffin is lowered. The burial
service is then read, and the simple rite concludes with
a benediction.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">289</a></span></p>

<p>Not least interesting among the annals of Herrnhut
are incidents arising out of the wars which have afflicted
Germany since the place was founded. All day the Brethren
heard the roar of cannon when Frederick won his
great victory at Lowositz; and a few days later, forty-eight
of them had to keep watch against an apprehended
foray of Trenck's wild Pandours. In 1757, General
Zastrow quartered suddenly four thousand men upon
them spitefully, and in defiance of a royal order to the
contrary, keeping the peaceful folk in alarm all night;
but the troops were withdrawn in the morning, and an
indemnity was paid for the mischief they had committed.
At times, long trains of men, horses, and artillery
would pass through without intermission for a
whole day&mdash;now Prussians, now Austrians, now heathen
Croats. In the same year three thousand officers visited
the place, among whom, during three weeks of the
summer, were thirty-four princes, seventy-eight counts,
and one hundred and forty-six nobles of other degree.
Numbers of them attended the religious services of the
Brethren. The Abbé Victor was one of the visitors,
and on his return to Russia he said so much in praise of
the Herrnhuters, that the emperor gave him permission
to establish the colony of Sarepta in Southern Russia,
which still exists.</p>

<p>In 1766 came the Emperor Joseph II., and by his
pleasing manners and friendly inquiries made a "lasting
impression" on the minds of the Brethren. In October,
1804, Francis I.&mdash;the Franzl of the Tyrolese&mdash;with his
wife. In 1810, Gustaf Adolf IV. of Sweden, who expressed
a wish to become a member. In 1813 the
Emperor Alexander came as a visitor, and examined all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">290</a></span>
things carefully; and it is recorded of him that while
the children sang he stood among them bareheaded.
He was followed by three of the famous marshals&mdash;Kellermann,
Victor, and Macdonald.</p>

<p>This was a terrible year. With the retreat from
Moscow came train on train of wounded Saxons on the
way to Dresden. Requisition on requisition was made
for linen and provisions; and one day, when no more
wagons were left, the Brethren had to supply two
hundred wheelbarrow-loads of rations. Night after
night they saw the lurid glow of fires, for seventy-one
places were burnt in the circles of Bautzen and Görlitz.
Then came Cossacks, Calmucks, and squadrons of savage
Bashkirs, armed with bows and arrows. Then Poniatowsky
with his Poles, and Saxon Uhlans; and a review
was held in a meadow behind the <i>Schwesternhaus</i>, and
the sisters made hundreds of little pennons for the Polish
lances.</p>

<p>In August, Napoleon was at Zittau. Daily skirmishes
took place among Prussians, Poles, and Russians, for
possession of the <i>Hutberg</i>&mdash;the best look-out for miles
around. In September, Blucher came with Gneisenau
and Prince Wilhelm, and had the Prussian head-quarters
here for five days.</p>

<p>On the whole, Herrnhut suffered but little in comparison
with other places; yet the Brethren were not
slow to rejoice for the evacuation of Germany by the
enemy, and the restoration of peace. "Praise and
Thank-feasts" were held, with illuminations and fireworks;
some of the fires being green and white, to
represent the national colours of Saxony.

<p class="p2">I fear, good-natured reader, that you will find this
chapter too much like a catalogue. I am, however,
admonished by the number of my pages that a swift
conclusion is desirable. Moreover, my publisher&mdash;an
amiable man in most respects&mdash;is apt to be dogmatic on
questions of paper and print, fancying that he knows
best, so I have no alternative but to humour him; and,
after all, you will perhaps say that it is well to get over
the ground as fast as possible when one comes again
upon much-beaten tracks.</p>

<p>From Herrnhut I travelled by rail to Dresden&mdash;Pianopolis
as some residents call it. Taken as a whole,
it is a singularly heavy-looking and gloomy city: some
of the principal streets reminded me of back-streets in
Oxford. I saw the picture-gallery and the great library;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">292</a></span>
and desirous to see what our forefathers used to see at
the Globe&mdash;a play acted by daylight in a roofless play-house&mdash;I
went to the summer theatre in the <i>Grossen
Garten</i>. It is an agreeable pastime in fine weather, for
you can see green tree-tops all round above the walls,
and feel the breeze, and enjoy your tankard of <i>Waldschloess</i>&mdash;that
excellent Dresden beer&mdash;while looking
at the performance. A clever actress from Berlin made
her first appearance; she played in the two pieces, and
by her vivacity made amends for the miserable music,
which was unworthy of Pianopolis, and of the leader's
intense laboriousness in beating time.</p>

<p>I should like to take you with me in my walk
through the Saxon Switzerland; but can only glance
thereat for reasons already shown. If you have read Sir
John Forbes's picturesque description of that romantic
country published last year in his <i>Sight-Seeing in Germany</i>,
you will not want another. I may, however, tell
you, that you may visit all the most remarkable places
in two days. Leave Dresden by steamer at six in the
morning; disembark at Wehlen, walk from thence
through the <i>Uttewalde Grund</i> to the <i>Bastei</i>, where, from
the summit of a bastion rock springing from the Elbe,
you have a magnificent view, with enough of water in it.
You will see numerous specimens of those flat-topped
hills, resembling the bases of mighty columns, such as
we saw from the <i>Milleschauer</i>, and crag on crag, ridge
on ridge, the gray stone shaded by forest for miles around.
You will perceive Adersbach on a great scale; the same
sort of sandstone split up in all directions, but the precipitous
masses wide apart, isolated, and with glens and
vales between all, glad with foliage and running water,
instead of crevices and alleys.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">293</a></span></p>

<p>From the <i>Bastei</i> you plunge down the zigzags among
the crags to the <i>Amselgrund</i>, past the waterfall, and by
wild ways to the <i>Teufelsbruch</i> and the <i>Hochstein</i>, an
isolated crag, from which you look down into the
Devil's Kettle, 350 feet deep. Then down through the
<i>Wolfschlucht</i>, a crevice in the cliff, which, where you
descend by ladders, looks very much like a wolf's-gully.
It brings you into the <i>Polenzthal</i>, where on the grassy
margin of a trout stream, beneath the shade of birches,
precipitous cliffs towering high aloft, something grand
and beautiful at every bend, you will believe it the
loveliest scene of all. Then up the <i>Brand</i>&mdash;another
out-look, and from thence down to Schandau, where you
pass the night.</p>

<p>On the second day, walk up the <i>Kirnitschthal</i> to the
<i>Kuhstall</i>, a broad arch in a honeycombed rock on the
top of a hill; from thence to the Little Winterberg and
Great Winterberg, the latter more than 1700 feet high&mdash;the
highest point of the district, commanding a
grand prospect over hill and hollow, crag and forest.
While gazing around in admiration, you will perhaps
wish that the old name&mdash;Meissner Highlands&mdash;had not
been changed, for there is but little of the real Switzerland
in the view.</p>

<p>Then on to the <i>Prebischthor</i>, crossing the frontier on
the way into Bohemia at a lonely spot, uninfested as
yet by guards or barrier. The <i>Prebischthor</i> is a huge
arch, more than a hundred feet high, also on a hill-top,
1300 feet above the sea. Two mighty columns support
a massive block, a hundred feet in length, forming a
marvellous specimen of natural architecture. You can
walk under and around its base, and look at the landscape
through the opening, or mount to the summit and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">294</a></span>
look down sheer eight hundred feet into the <i>Prebischgrund</i>.
Here, as everywhere else, you find an inn, good
beer, and musicians, a throng of tourists, and an album
filled with names, and rhyming attempts at wit and sentiment.</p>

<p>From the <i>Prebischthor</i> you descend by the valley of
the Kamnitz to Herniskretschen, a village built on a
narrow level between tall frowning cliffs and the Elbe.
I arrived here in time for the steamer at two o'clock, by
which I returned to Dresden. I had seen the Saxon
Switzerland from all the best points of view, and saw all
the romantic course of the river, except the eight miles
from Tetschen to Herniskretschen. A pleasanter two
days' trip could not well be imagined. Once at Wehlen,
the places to be visited are but from three to four miles
apart; the way from one to the other is easy to find, and
there is constant diversity of scenery, to say nothing of
the talkative groups of Germans with whom you may
join fellowship. But, in truth, it is a region to loiter
in, and you will wish that weeks were yours instead of
scanty days.</p>

<p>Soon after noon of the next day I was in Berlin.
Travel the same route, and you will no longer wonder
at the rapturous excitement of the Germans in the <i>Riesengebirge</i>.
The country is one great plain&mdash;little fields,
marshes, sluggish streams, ponds covered with water-lilies,
windmills and sandy wastes sprinkled with a few
trees that look miserable at having to grow in such a
dreary land. Here and there a winding road&mdash;a mere
deep-rutted track&mdash;winds across the landscape, making
it look, if possible, still more melancholy. Look out
when you will, you see the same monotonous features.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">295</a></span></p>

<p>In our own happy country you would have the additional
sorrow of an uncomfortable carriage. To know
what outrageous inflictions can be perpetrated by railway
monopoly, and endured by your long-suffering
countrymen, just ride for once from London to Lowestofft
in an Eastern Counties third-class carriage&mdash;you
will have more than enough of North German scenery
and of English discomfort, but without the compensations
of German beer and German coffee. Or vary your
experiences by a journey to Winchester in a second-class
on the South-Western line, and try to enjoy the
landscape through the wooden shutter which the Company
give you for a window. Go to Euston-square&mdash;anywhere
in fact&mdash;and you find that the passenger
with most money in his pocket is the one most cared
for. Even the Great Western and South-Eastern Companies,
who have outgrown the short-sighted habit of
building dungeons and calling them carriages&mdash;even
these mighty monopolists condemn their second-class
passengers to a wooden seat.</p>

<p>But on the line from Dresden to Berlin the third-class
carriages are far more commodious than any second-class
I have ever seen in England&mdash;except two or three at the
Great Exhibition, which, perhaps, were meant only for
show. The seats are broad, hollowed, and not flat, and
with space enough between for the comfortable placing
of your legs. The roof is lofty. You can stand upright
with your hat on. At either end a broad shelf is fixed
for small packages and light luggage; and more than all,
the same civility and attention are extended by all the
functionaries to third-class passengers as to the first.
We brag of our liberty, and not without reason; but let
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">296</a></span>
us remember that the foreigner, though afflicted with
passports, travels at less cost and with more comfort than
we do.</p>

<p>Here, too, my fellow-passengers made merry over the
"<i>Palmerston gehänget</i>" story; and many questions had
I to answer concerning the coming marriage of the
Prussian Prince and English Princess. I gave the same
reply as to the Dresdener in the palace at Fischbach. One
of the company, who told us he was a professor of literature
at Berlin, inclined to be saucy. It was all a mistake
to suppose that there was one jot more liberty in
England than in Prussia. He could speak English, and
knew all about it. Unluckily, by way of proving how
well he could speak English, he said we should arrive
at "Twelve past half;" whereupon I set the others
laughing to take the conceit out of him. He relapsed
into German, and looked so unhappy, that, by way of
consolation, I told him of a countryman of his in England
who went to keep an appointment at "clock
five."</p>

<p>Berlin is a dreary, malodorous city, or rather an enormous
village beginning to try to be a city; and fortunate
in being the residence of men of taste and real
artists who know what architecture and sculpture ought
to be, as demonstrated by the improvements and embellishments
around the palace and in the approach to
that fine street <i>Unter den Linden</i>. You can hire a
droschky to take you anywhere within the walls for
fivepence; but be patient, for whether droschky or omnibus,
the pace is as slow as if the drivers had to work
for nothing. <i>Pour le roi de Prusse</i>, as the French say.</p>

<p>Many a portrait of the English Princess Royal, along
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">297</a></span>
with that of her future consort, did I see in the print-sellers'
windows; and on the morrow I saw how the
Berliners pass their Sunday: not with shops open all the
day as in Paris, but with much beer, music, and tobacco
in the environs. I was simple enough to walk out to
the Zoological Garden&mdash;a few pens very widely scattered
in a neglected forest plantation, containing specimens
of swine, poultry, goats, and kine, all made as
much of as if they were in Little Pedlington. From
thence I walked out to Charlottenburg, notwithstanding
the offensive drains which border the road the whole
distance, and saw the tasteful mausoleum in the palace
grounds, and the lazy carp in the big pond. The Opera
House was open in the evening with <i>Satanella</i>, a
"fantastic ballet," in three acts; and crowds made their
way out to Kroll's Garden&mdash;the Cremorne of Berlin&mdash;where
a play was acted in the theatre, and two orchestras
outside kept up a constant succession of lively
music: one striking up as the other ended. The number
of tall people among the throng was remarkable,
and not less so the rapidity with which beer and coffee,
cakes and cutlets, were consumed. The numerous troop
of waiters had not an idle moment.</p>

<p>I wished to see the place where the most terrible
tragedy of the Thirty Years' War had been acted&mdash;where
Tilly and Pappenheim&mdash;Bloodthirsty and Ferocious&mdash;sacked
a flourishing city just as the foremost of
the Swedish horse, commanded by Gustavus the Avenger,
came within sight of its walls. So I journeyed to
Magdeburg: always the same great plain on either
side; but hereabouts fertile, and among the best of the
corn-land of Europe. The early train travels quickly:
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">298</a></span>
it accomplished the distance in a little more than three
hours.</p>

<p>I went directly to the cathedral, and, after a view of
its noble interior, mounted to the gallery, which runs
all round the top without a break. I stayed up there
two hours pacing slowly round, surveying the busy
town, the bustle of boats and barges on the Elbe, the
citadel, the long line of fortification, and thinking over
the history of the terrible siege. Besides the cathedral,
the town contains but little to repay an exploration, and
the people generally have a shabby look, as I proved by
experiment, so I walked up the river bank to one of the
suburban pleasure-gardens till the hour of departure
approached. At five in the afternoon&mdash;away by train
for Hamburg. Always the same great plain, heaved
here and there into gentle swells. We slept at Wittenberg,
and were off again the next morning long
before the dew was dry. The plain abates somewhat of
its monotony in Mecklenburg, and breaks into low hills
with green valleys and pleasant woods between; and
here, instead of groschen and dollars, we found schillings
and marks&mdash;schillings worth a penny apiece. Shortly
before eleven our long journey ended.</p>

<p>I went to the steam-boat office; took a place for
London; asked one of the clerks which was the tallest
church in Hamburg; left my knapsack under his desk,
and made my way through the maze of picturesque old
streets to St. Michael's. The tower is 460 feet in
height, and you have to mount hundreds of stairs, the
last flight, quite open to the sky, running in a spiral
round the pillars of the belfry. Some weak heads turn
back here; but if you continue, the view from the little
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">299</a></span>
chamber at the top will reward you. A vast panorama
meets the eye. Miles away into Hanover and Holstein,
all the territory of Hamburg, across Mecklenburg, and
down the broad river well-nigh to the sea, sixty miles
distant. The city itself is an interesting sight: the
contrast between the old and new so great; the bustle
on the Elbe and in the streets; the numerous canals,
basins, dams, and havens; the planted walks, all enclosed
by green and undulating environs, make up a
picture that you will be reluctant to leave. Some of
the windows of the little chamber are fitted with glass
of different colours, so that at pleasure you may look
out on a fairy scene below. The charge for the ascent
is one mark.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when perambulating the streets, you will
discover that Hamburg is a city not less interesting
when viewed from the ground. The narrow streets,
the old architecture, the variety of costumes, the curious
ways of the traders, will arrest your attention at
every step. And you will find much to commend in
the building of the new quarter, and in the well-kept
grounds and walks by the Exchange and around the
Alster.</p>

<p>Seeing all this, I regretted that my stay would be but
for a few hours: however, I improved those hours as
diligently as possible. I walked out to Altona, and
lived for an hour under the sovereignty of Denmark
while looking at the old council-house and some other
quaint specimens of architecture. Then turning in the
opposite direction I rode out to Horn by omnibus;
walked from thence across the heath and through the
groves to Wansbeck, and rode back by a different road&mdash;a
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">300</a></span>
little trip in which I saw much to admire in the
pretty wayside residences of the Hamburgers, situate so
pleasantly among gardens and trees, and the inmates
taking their evening meal on the grass-plot in front.<a name="FNanchor_K" id="FNanchor_K" href="#Footnote_K" class="fnanchor">[K]</a></p>

<p>I kept up my explorations till the approach of midnight
warned me that it was time to embark. The watch
at the city-gate let me out on payment of the accustomed
toll&mdash;twopence at ten o'clock, a shilling at eleven&mdash;and
I groped my way along the quay to the steamer
<i>Countess of Lonsdale</i>. When I woke the next morning
the pilot was being landed at Glückstadt; and we
steamed across the North Sea with no other incident
than that of nearly running down a Flemish fishing-boat
in broad daylight; and yet we had a man on the look-out.
But for the quick eye of the captain&mdash;who was telling
amusing stories about the German fleet to a party of us
lounging around him on the quarter-deck&mdash;and his
sudden "hard a-port!" the little vessel would have
been cut in two. As it was, she escaped but by a few
inches.</p>

<p>During the lazy leisure of a day at sea, I reckoned
the sum of my journeyings and outlay. I had walked
three hundred and fifty miles, and expended&mdash;up to
Hamburg&mdash;fourteen pounds. The passage to London,
with etceteras, including an unconscionable steward's-fee,
amounted to nearly three pounds more.</p>

<p>A voyage of forty-eight hours brought us to London;
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">301</a></span>
and at four in the morning of the 1st of August we
stepped on shore at St. Katherine's Wharf. It was a
lovely morning: even London looked picturesque in the
clear rosy light. The opportunity was favourable, and
I took it for an hour's study of the busiest phenomena of
Billingsgate. Then I walked awhile, and sat on a certain
doorstep reading Goldsmith's <i>Traveller</i> till the
maid came down, very early, at a quarter-past seven.
Then I exchanged thick boots and a comfortable coat
for the garb of Cockneydom. And then&mdash;sensations of
liberty tingling yet in every limb, and swarming with
happy recollections through my brain&mdash;I went and crept
once more into the old official harness.</p>

<p>Harness in which I earn glorious holidays.
